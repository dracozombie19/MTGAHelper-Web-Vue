{"ChannelFireball (LSV)":{"RatingsBySet":{"ELD":{"Ratings":[{"CardName":"Acclaimed Contender","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Acclaimed Contender is an efficient creature even if you don’t get the trigger, and it’s not hard to construct a deck with plenty of support. Knights are the highest priority, but it’s a nice bonus that this can pick up a few other categories as well (including auras like Trapped in the Tower)."},{"CardName":"All That Glitters","Rating":"1.0","Description":"For this to truly be gold, it needs to reliably give +3/+3. That’s a tall ask, and often opens you up pretty badly to removal or bounce. This looks like fool’s gold to me, and I wouldn’t recommend trying to make it work."},{"CardName":"Archon of Absolution","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This absolutely is maindeckable, as it’s a very annoying card to play against even without the protection. It swings for three in the air while hindering the opponent’s attacks, and if they do have Plains in their deck, sometimes it’s immune to removal and a great blocker as well."},{"CardName":"Ardenvale Paladin","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Ardenvale Paladin is a serviceable blocker with or without adamant, and getting a 3/6 for four isn’t such a big payoff that this would push me towards mono-white. It’s a fine addition to any Knight deck, and if you do end up heavy white, it gets a bit of a bump."},{"CardName":"Ardenvale Tactician","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ardenvale Tactician is the perfect addition to any aggressive deck, as it both pressures the opponent as a 2/3 flier and can tap down some blockers on the way in. It’s a fine card for control decks too, though they will get a little less mileage out of either half. The creature here is good enough that you don’t need to cast the adventure to get full value, but having the option to do so adds a lot."},{"CardName":"Bartered Cow","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’d be eager to trade this cow for almost any other playable, though it is playable if you need a little more beef in your deck. Leaving behind a Food token is a nice perk, and if you do combo this with discard effects you will feel very clever."},{"CardName":"Beloved Princess","Rating":"1.0","Description":"As beloved as she may be, this princess gets defeated in combat by any old dork, and this pseudo-evasion doesn’t make up for that. It is cute that if you give her +2/+2, she’s pretty hard to stop, so I’d want multiple good pieces of equipment before considering her."},{"CardName":"Charming Prince","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I guess being charming is about the little details, as Charming Prince combines a lot of minor effects into a very impactful card. This helps you scry into action, gains life when you’re behind, and can flicker creatures with ETB effects if you have them. That’s a lot for two mana, and this is a card I’d always be thrilled to play."},{"CardName":"The Circle of Loyalty","Rating":"4.5","Description":"With literal zero Knights or legendary spells in your deck, this card is a tad overcosted. It’s still powerful, and definitely something I’d play, so that shows how good this is once you do start to enable it. If you can get this down to four or five mana it’s a steal, and randomly triggering off legendary uncommon Knights just feels unfair. This isn’t quite Ethereal Absolution, but it’s a card that will swing almost any game in which it appears."},{"CardName":"Deafening Silence","Rating":"0.0","Description":"As much as I expect to lose to this in Constructed, it’s not a card you should ever play in a Limited deck."},{"CardName":"Faerie Guidemother","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The rating on this definitely goes up the more aggressive you are, as this is a nice combination of abilities. Gift of the Fae is the more powerful half, and represents 4-6 extra damage most games, which is perfect when combined with a small evasive threat. Both halves of this are pointed towards beatdown, so as long as you don’t jam this in a control deck it will lead you to where you want to go."},{"CardName":"Flutterfox","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Flutterfox is likely to fly by the time you need it to, though in a deck that has zero ways to give it wings the rating drops. Two-mana 2/2’s are good on turn two at a base level, so any that also have utility later (like this one) tend to get pretty high ratings."},{"CardName":"Fortifying Provisions","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The 1 toughness this provides is more impactful than you might think, though it still takes a specific reason to want this effect. This gives you and enchantment and an artifact in play for cards that care about those types, and enables the food-matters cards as well. I also like this for matchups where you and your opponent’s creatures are of a similar size, making it a solid sb option."},{"CardName":"Giant Killer","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Both halves of this card are playable on their own, which is a recipe for a very powerful card indeed. My inclination is to wait and see if you can find something to chop down before playing this as a 1/2, since that effect is so good, but against blue/white decks you will often just want to run out the tapper. Either way, this is a fantastic card."},{"CardName":"Glass Casket","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Efficient removal that leaves you with an artifact in play is worth its weight in gold, even if this misses against big creatures."},{"CardName":"Happily Ever After","Rating":"0.0","Description":"This has a weak symmetrical effect to start, and an unobtainable alternate win condition. Let the memes flow."},{"CardName":"Harmonious Archon","Rating":"4.5","Description":"If your opponent can’t kill Harmonious Archon, it completely takes over the game, as it will by definition be the biggest creature on the board and it comes with two 3/3’s. If they can kill it, you are left with two 1/1’s, which makes the exchange profitable. That meets the definition of a bomb for me, with the only drawback being that this is a dicey play if the opponent has too many small creatures in play."},{"CardName":"Hushbringer","Rating":"2.5","Description":"A 1/2 flying lifelinker is actually pretty good in a set full of equipment, and if your deck is light on ETB/death abilities, then this will usually be annoying to the opponent at least once per game. That’s enough to maindeck this, even if the art looks like a 90’s album cover."},{"CardName":"Knight of the Keep","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m going to do my best to keep this out of my deck, though with enough Knight-matters cards (say 3+), it’s a fine playable."},{"CardName":"Linden, the Steadfast Queen","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This rating assumes you’re mono-white or nearly so, as Linden gets quite a bit weaker once you go more towards an even color split. She swings a race nicely, and can help enable aggressive strategies quite well, since she gains life on attacks and is available to block. I wouldn’t go mono-white for Linden but would prioritize her once I was already heading that direction."},{"CardName":"Lonesome Unicorn","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Neither the Unicorn nor the Knight is a fantastic deal, but getting both in one card makes me very interested. Drawing this in your opening hand sets you up to have a fine curve, and getting two decently-sized vigilance creatures in one card is a good deal. I wouldn’t want too many of this card, as it is expensive, so perhaps it’s at its best when it is indeed lonesome."},{"CardName":"Mysterious Pathlighter","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m optimistic about the adventure payoffs in this set. Maybe I just like action, but cards like this seem quite good to me. The pathlighter is a 3-mana 2/2 flier, which is fine on its own, and all the adventure cards are cards I already want to play. Buffing them makes the whole package look very good, and when a payoff is rewarding me for playing good cards, it tends to work out well."},{"CardName":"Outflank","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’m wary of removal that requires things to be going well to work. If you’re behind, this often does nothing, and it can easily get messed up by a timely bounce or removal spell in response. That said, this is very efficient when it does work, and I’d tend to play it in any deck with a good creature count (14+)."},{"CardName":"Prized Griffin","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Play mediocre games, win mediocre prizes. This is a fine playable, but nothing special, as the 5-drop slot tends to be one that has plenty of options."},{"CardName":"Rally for the Throne","Rating":"2.5","Description":"If you can reliably gain the life here, this is a strong card. Getting two more blockers plus a bunch of life is a great defensive play, and it enables go-wide decks nicely. I’d either want to have 11+ white sources or a use for tokens before playing this, but it’s great if you meet either condition."},{"CardName":"Realm-Cloaked Giant","Rating":"5.0","Description":"Realm-Cloaked Giant is fantastic. Not only is it a sweeper plus a huge finisher all in one card, but this being attached to a creature means you can reuse it so easily. Any bounce spell or way to get a creature back from the graveyard means more and more sweepers, so starting with this card in a draft leads to some really nice options."},{"CardName":"Righteousness","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m not a big fan of defensive combat tricks, because too much needs to go right for them to work, and when they do, at best you got a mana-efficient 1-for-1. I’d look to sideboard this in against opponents with huge creatures, but not maindeck it (unless you’re really looking to get a Fling combo going)."},{"CardName":"Shepherd of the Flock","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This may look like a high rating for such a simple pair of cards, but I really like how these combine. Usher to Safety will often net you a card, whether it’s saving a creature from removal or a combat where they played a trick, or even just getting a second ETB trigger from one of our creatures (or letting you get back both halves of an adventure). Add to that a cheap creature with 3 power and you have a winner, making this a very solid card without much need for investment."},{"CardName":"Shining Armor","Rating":"1.0 // 2.5","Description":"If you have enough Knights, this becomes an effective combat trick. All you need for this to be good is to win one combat with it, after which it’s just free value. It is expensive to move around, so the Knight part is critical, as it won’t shine unless you get the first bite for free."},{"CardName":"Silverflame Ritual","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m not too impressed with Silverflame Ritual. One counter isn’t enough of a payoff to really go wide, and this being a sorcery limits the blowout potential. The adamant bonus is small enough that it doesn’t move the needle much either."},{"CardName":"Silverflame Squire","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Adding a decent combat trick to that makes this a winner in my book. I would usually just play this on turn two if it’s in my opening hand, as waiting around to try and get full value isn’t necessary."},{"CardName":"Syr Alin, the Lion's Claw","Rating":"3.5","Description":"You don’t need to be Alin on cheap creatures to make this good enough, as a 4/4 first striker is a beater and pumping your team is good even with just 1-2 other threats. Granted, if you do go wide, Syr Alin does reward you, I’m just making sure you know it isn’t necessary."},{"CardName":"Trapped in the Tower","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Not hitting fliers is a pretty big drawback, as part of the point of removal is dealing with evasive threats. That said, two mana to take anything out of commission is big, and shutting down activated abilities can come in handy. Look out though: if the opponent can give one of their creatures flying, even later, this will fall off (which makes sense since the creature is no longer trapped if it can fly)."},{"CardName":"True Love's Kiss","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m going to start this as a sideboard-only card, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that changed once we see how many artifacts/enchantments make their way into maindecks. It’s also nice that this is a 2-for-1, as it rewards you when you do find a target."},{"CardName":"Venerable Knight","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Venerable Knight is efficient enough that you will be happy with it in any aggressive deck, and giving a +1/+1 counter away on death makes it worth playing in any Knight deck. Those two things combined likely encompass most all white decks, making this a solid card."},{"CardName":"Worthy Knight","Rating":"3.5","Description":"If you get even one token from this, it’s great, and at two or more it’s a real hero. That makes it a worthy early pick, and one worth drafting around."},{"CardName":"Youthful Knight","Rating":"3.0","Description":"First strike lets this dominate early, and any pump spells make it a substantial threat later. That’s a lot for two mana, and having the creature type Knight is a bonus as well."},{"CardName":"Animating Faerie","Rating":"2.5 // 3.5","Description":"If you have few or no targets, this is a perfectly serviceable flier, and worth including in your deck. If you have a bunch of ways to make Food tokens, or other cheap artifacts, this becomes a potent threat and even an early pick."},{"CardName":"Brazen Borrower","Rating":"4.0","Description":"The combination of two fairly innocuous effects leads to a very powerful card. Getting a flash flier plus a bounce spell is a great deal for 3 and 2 mana respectively, and you don’t even need to pay it all at once. You rarely are going to miss out on Petty Theft, so think of this more as a bounce spell with a creature attached than anything else. I do have to dock it flavor points, though, since instead of stealing this actually returns things to their owner–not the same thing at all."},{"CardName":"Charmed Sleep","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Blue doesn’t do much better than this when it comes to common removal, so don’t sleep on picking these up. For three mana, this deals with just about anything, and it even sticks around to enable any cards you have that care about controlling enchantments (which is a minor theme of UW)."},{"CardName":"Corridor Monitor","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The untap ability is mostly a throwaway, though it is a nice sideboard option against Charmed Sleep. Mostly what you are getting here is a 1/4 for two mana, which is a perfectly sound deal if you’re looking for defensive options."},{"CardName":"Didn't Say Please","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This gets a slight bump due to the mill theme of the set; most decks still won’t want a 3-mana counterspell but if you have cards that care about filling the opponent’s graveyard, I wouldn’t be displeased to run this. Also, you’re practically required to scold the opponent when you cast this in person."},{"CardName":"Emry, Lurker of the Loch","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"In a deck without artifacts, Emry is unplayable. In a deck with 3+, she becomes very strong, especially if those artifacts are creatures. Getting to repeatedly play creatures out of your graveyard is quite good, and she even fills your bin for other purposes, like Raise Dead effects."},{"CardName":"Fae of Wishes","Rating":"3.5","Description":"First of all, a 1/4 flier for 2 mana is a great deal. That makes this playable on its face, and that’s without the decent bonus of finding whatever the best spell in your sideboard is. Note that even in best of one, you have a sideboard, so this works well regardless.\r\n\r\nAs for what you should leave in your sideboard to wish for, I wouldn’t leave premium removal there, since that’s still better off in your deck, but narrow sideboard answers are great, as are expensive or clunky spells (since spending four to get them usually means you’re in the mid or lategame already). If you are looking to make a last cut, this is a good tiebreaker, as cutting a spell from your maindeck gives you more options. Basically, you want a few choices when you cast Granted, but you don’t want to make your deck weaker to accommodate that."},{"CardName":"Faerie Vandal","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The “draw 2 cards” theme is well-supported in this set, and I like the payoffs across the board. Faerie Vandal just needs one counter to be worth the price, and it’s not too hard to get there. It also can ambush x/1’s nicely, and is a cheap flier that can wear equipment. I’d be happy speculating on this early, and later if you have enough enablers, this becomes one of the better cards in your deck."},{"CardName":"Folio of Fancies","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I actually fancy the folio more than you might expect. It’s very slow, and a card that takes some work, but it looks like an effective finisher in a control/mill deck. Imagine this: at the end of the opponent’s turn, you make both players draw 3-4 cards, then use it to mill 5-6 cards on your turn. On their turn, they are unlikely to play out all their cards, so you can keep milling for substantial amounts, all while having more resources to defend yourself since you’ve been drawing extra cards as well. To make this work, I’d highly prioritize cheap bounce spells and cheap defensive creatures, with cards like Merfolk Secretkeeper being perfect. You want to be in a spot where you are playing cards each turn while using the Folio, which is a hard-to-stop route to victory.\r\n\r\nThat all said, this is not good without some work, so don’t just jam it into any old deck."},{"CardName":"Frogify","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’ve largely not been a fan of this effect, but this still is a playable way to take care of large threats. I dislike that it leaves your opponent with a relevant game piece, so if you are going the Frogify route, try and construct your deck such that it doesn’t care about a 1/1."},{"CardName":"Gadwick, the Wizened","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Triple-blue is a lot less costly on a card that wants 6+ mana to begin with, as you can play this in a 2-color deck without worrying too much about having UUU right on turn three or four. Gadwick is really powerful, and I’d happily play it without the second ability, as XUUU draw X plus a 3/3 is fantastic. The tap ability means that you will win most games where you slam this, which makes it a bomb in my book."},{"CardName":"Hypnotic Sprite","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m a big fan of this Sprite (which, unlike the beverage, is an actual high pick). Paying UU for a 2/1 flier is great, and adding a situational counter to that is an awesome bonus. I’d tend towards running this out there turn two if you have good three and four mana plays already, but if you don’t you likely want to save it for the counter (and resulting two-for-one)."},{"CardName":"Into the Story","Rating":"2.0 // 3.5","Description":"Drawing four cards for four mana is well above what you’d expect to get (unless you’re greedier than I am, which is unlikely), so where this lands depends on how good your deck is enabling it and when you want to cast it. In a dedicated mill deck, it’s a solid 3.5, and in a slow control deck it’s always playable, but it’s a little expensive in a normal midrange deck with no enablers. I like speculating on this early, as the effect is powerful enough to justify doing some work for it."},{"CardName":"The Magic Mirror","Rating":"0.0","Description":"“Mirror mirror on the wall, you’re the most unplayable of them all”\r\n\r\nI’m not sold on The Magic Mirror, and in fact, recommend against playing it in your deck under all circumstances. The problem is that once this gets going, you probably just end up decking yourself, and the kind of decks that can actually cast this for a reasonable amount don’t have the best finishing potential. Plus, investing this much in a long-game card advantage mechanism that doesn’t give you the time to actually use the cards (since you probably deck 4-6 turns after casting this) will almost never translate into more wins. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing, and drawing 4+ cards per turn is not where you want to be, given that you can’t turn off the firehose."},{"CardName":"Mantle of Tides","Rating":"1.0 // 2.5","Description":"Mantle of Tides is a little too expensive to equip to be worth playing if you aren’t getting it for free most of the time, but it is good in a deck built to utilize it. If you have 4+ ways to draw extra cards, and a couple of those are at instant speed, this can be a potent threat and something that really annoys the opponent while making combat decisions."},{"CardName":"Merfolk Secretkeeper","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"This is most certainly going to be the most overdrafted card in the set. People love mill and people love low-impact one-drops, and this is both of those PLUS a shiny new mechanic. Still, it does actually have utility. It enables the cards that care about filling the opponent’s graveyard, it blocks early, and given enough of them, can actually deck the opponent. I think that fewer decks will want this than people think, but once you have 3+ good payoffs for the mill effect, it’s actually a desirable card."},{"CardName":"Midnight Clock","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Now this is the kind of control finisher I can actually get behind. In a deck that can realistically stall out the game (and run out the clock), this provides some extra mana early and a powerful draw/recursion engine late. That’s good enough for me, and I like the idea of playing this in my control decks that are trying to go big. It’s slow, but a mana rock for 3 isn’t the worst deal if you get upside, and the upside here is quite large."},{"CardName":"Mirrormade","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The payoff here is ultimately not that great, as you are getting a copy of a solid card but rarely something broken. The downside is when this rots in your hand, and that’s what makes me skeptical. In a deck with 5+ good things to copy, I’d play this, but otherwise I’d avoid it unless you see something from the opponent’s deck that you really want to copy."},{"CardName":"Mistford River Turtle","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Turts McGurts here is a solid defender and a surprisingly threatening attacker. This rarely will die in combat, so getting something powerful through is a nice ability, and this can sit back and block as needed. I’d tend to want this in my deck, though note that it doesn’t play nicely with Humans."},{"CardName":"Moonlit Scavengers","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"In a deck with just a couple of artifacts/enchantments, this is a little overcosted, though it’s still big enough to have an impact. In a deck that reliably can trigger the ability, it’s great, and a card I’d be very happy playing. I’d look for 4+ cards that make this happen, with a bonus if they are cards that tend to stay in play (like Charmed Sleep or Trapped in the Tower)."},{"CardName":"Mystical Dispute","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Mana Leak for three mana is not a card I want to play, so I’m largely regarding this as a sideboard option. I’d always board this in against an opponent with a bunch of blue spells, as paying one mana to counter something is an insane tempo swing."},{"CardName":"Opt","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Opt has never been better. It cleanly enables the draw-2 mechanic while being a solid playable in its own right, and all that for just one mana. It’s also at instant speed, which makes a lot of the plays more threatening, so if you are in blue-red I’d expect to heavily prioritize Opt."},{"CardName":"Overwhelmed Apprentice","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"This is similar to Merfolk Secretkeeper, though scrying for 2 is good even if you aren’t getting much from the mill plan. I have this as a marginal playable without combos (that’s not carte blanche to take this early – you know who you are), and a good addition to any mill deck."},{"CardName":"Queen of Ice","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Queen of Ice operates as a good defensive or offensive card, which basically just makes it a good card. It can lock something down on curve or act as a 5-mana play, as well as just being a decent card on three mana. Too many of these may get a little clunky (it’s not exactly like Frost Lynx in that regard), but I like this card quite a bit."},{"CardName":"Run Away Together","Rating":"2.5","Description":"As with most bounce spells, there are diminishing returns, but the first copy of this is going to be pretty good. Note that you need both targets to cast it, so it’s a little limited, but saving your creature from removal and getting a free bounce is pretty nice. It also can proactively bounce their creature plus your ETB creature (think adventures), so I’d lean towards wanting one in most decks."},{"CardName":"Sage of the Falls","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Sage of the Falls is quite big, making it a solid bit of board impact, and has a recurring good ability. That’s a recipe for success, and I’d be happy with this in any deck, as it finds your good cards and prevents mana flood at a very low cost."},{"CardName":"So Tiny","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Flash is the key here, as this operates both as a combat trick and a removal spell. It can win close combats or lock down creatures, and once you fill their graveyard it goes way up in value. Once you know you’re the mill deck, this becomes a solid 3.0, but until then it’s worth slightly less."},{"CardName":"Steelgaze Griffin","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’m not the biggest fan of 5-drops that aren’t great on defense, as you often are tapping out to cast them in a spot where you want a blocker. That said, this can steel games quite easily, as a common 4/4 flier is not something you normally see. In the draw-2 deck, having a couple of these as a top-end sounds good to me."},{"CardName":"Stolen by the Fae","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Speaking of stealing games…\r\n\r\nNot only is this card the best Gaby Spartz token I’ve seen (look at the Faerie on the left), but it’s a huge swing in any game where you cast it. You can’t just make as many faeries as you want, since the X has to equal the target’s cost exactly, but bouncing a creature and getting 3+ tokens is insane. You can also bounce your own stuff if need be, though that will be less common."},{"CardName":"Syr Elenora, the Discerning","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I too am discerning when it comes to my 5-drops, but an x/4 that draws a card is well worth the cost. This will usually hit pretty hard, and the ability making it harder to target is sure to annoy the opponent."},{"CardName":"Tome Raider","Rating":"3.0","Description":"We may be spoiled by Cloudkin Seer, but that doesn’t make Tome Raider less of a good card. I’d always run this, and be happy playing as many as I could pick up, because a 1/1 flier that replaces itself is definitely worth paying three for. Plus, in the draw-2 deck, this triggers a bunch of abilities, which makes it even better than normal."},{"CardName":"Turn into a Pumpkin","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I look forward to turning many permanents into pumpkins over the course of the set, as the bounce + draw combination is always a good one. Unlike me, this even leaves leftovers sometimes, and that’s a bonus on top of an already-good card."},{"CardName":"Unexplained Vision","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Unexplained Vision is a powerful effect to be sure, but once you are in the 5+ cost territory you often won’t have time to skip a turn of playing cards that affect the board. I’d look to play this mainly in control decks, or occasionally as the top end in an aggro deck that needs a little more punch."},{"CardName":"Vantress Gargoyle","Rating":"3.5","Description":"The downside of this being unable to enter combat isn’t as big as you might think. It can block for the first good chunk of the game, which slows things down and gives you time to fill their graveyard. By the time you’re at less than 4 cards in hand it can usually start swinging, and all of that is a steal for just two mana. You don’t need to go out of your way to enable this, even if it does get a bit better in a dedicated mill deck."},{"CardName":"Vantress Paladin","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"In a normal 2-color deck, this is just about unplayable. In a mono-blue deck, it’s a solid beater. That gives you a pretty good idea of when you want this, and if you do end up in a 11-12 Island deck, this lands somewhere in between."},{"CardName":"Wishful Merfolk","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m not the biggest fan of defensive ground creatures that die to anything but a 1/1, and being able to pay to attack with this doesn’t help a whole lot. I’d play this if you really lacked 2-drops and wanted blockers but would wish not to otherwise."},{"CardName":"Witching Well","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"I actually like the look of this a lot in the artifact-matters style of decks. It comes down cheaply, gives you a small bonus, and when you no longer need an artifact in play you can cash it in for two cards. In a deck that gets no additional mileage out of this, I’d largely recommend against it, as it’s just a little too expensive to get full value."},{"CardName":"Ayara, First of Locthwain","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ayara requires a lot of black mana (and creatures), but rewards you richly for assembling those. She’s a loch to be an early pick, because each creature turning into a drain for 1 and another card (plus a chump block) is an ability worth building towards."},{"CardName":"Bake into a Pie","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is clearly the best common in the set, and a delicious first pick. Killing anything for four mana is already good, and getting some Food as a bonus is a wonderful deal."},{"CardName":"Barrow Witches","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"If you have five or more Knights in your deck, Barrow Witches is a fantastic 5-drop. It’s a solid 2-for-1 and leaves a relevant body on the table, which is a great deal. If you don’t have enough Knights, well, this is not a playable card."},{"CardName":"Belle of the Brawl","Rating":"3.0","Description":"A 3/2 menace Knight for 3 is a decent deal up front, and in a deck with at least a couple other Knights this does indeed brawl well. I like this card, and Knights seem supported enough to make this a fine early pick."},{"CardName":"Blacklance Paragon","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Blacklance Paragon is efficient and deadly–by itself, it basically reads as a spell that kills target attacking creature without flying and you gain 3 life. Once you add other Knights to the mix, it can spread the love, and make your 2/2 trade for a 5/5, on offense or defense. That’s a lot of action for just two mana, and I especially like how this is good on its own and better with friends."},{"CardName":"Bog Naughty","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Bog Naughty is a tad too expensive to run unless it’s well-fed (I am similar in that regard). If you do have a couple ways of generating Food tokens, this is a potent threat, as it lets you indulge in the food fight you always wanted to have. Most effects that make Food do so as a bonus, so when this kills something, you almost always got card advantage of some kind."},{"CardName":"Cauldron Familiar","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"This card really tickles my fancy, though it’s not the biggest payoff I’ve ever seen. Without Food, this is an ineffectual 1-drop, and not worth playing. With a lot of Food, this is a recurring chump blocker/sacrifice fodder, and it drains them out over time. That’s definitely good enough if you can make use of the 1/1 body, but not quite there if it’s just in a deck with a couple Food cards."},{"CardName":"The Cauldron of Eternity","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Cauldron is slow, but it’s definitely a bomb. It’s not hard to get 3 creatures in your graveyard, at which point this is a 6-mana spell that threatens to take over the game. It’s easy to imagine getting the game to a point where you have 5+ creatures in the bin, and that makes this just absurd. Also note that self-mill works even if this is in play, as it only puts creatures that die on the bottom, not creatures that get milled. This card is insane if you build towards it, and still very good even if you don’t."},{"CardName":"Cauldron's Gift","Rating":"2.0","Description":"If you can reliably hit the adamant here, this goes up a bit, as it gives you more options to reanimate. I also don’t mind this in a self-mill strategy, because making your deck more consistently have critical creatures in play is nice."},{"CardName":"Clackbridge Troll","Rating":"4.0","Description":"This may look like a high upside/high downside card, but in reality it doesn’t have much of a downside. If the opponent doesn’t have instant-speed removal, they’re eating 8 damage or the Troll is eating a goat, both of which are great for you. Even if they do remove the Troll, them having a couple 0/1’s isn’t a big deal, and if they don’t kill it, you get a huge advantage. This card is great, and I’m not just saying that because I am a fan of trolls."},{"CardName":"Epic Downfall","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Pure removal doesn’t usually get this high of a grade, but Epic Downfall is about as efficient as it gets. The only creatures it misses are creatures you probably don’t care all that much about, and killing anything for two mana is a fantastic deal."},{"CardName":"Eye Collector","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"Eye Collector is the weakest sort of build-around card–it’s nearly unplayable unless you care about the milling, and a marginal playable once you do. I’d only play this in a dedicated mill deck or a deck full of graveyard synergies, but even then it’s just not that impactful."},{"CardName":"Festive Funeral","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Five mana removal is a necessary evil, but when that removal is also conditional, my appetite wanes dramatically. It’s fine to play this in a creature-heavy deck, especially one that has a couple self-mill cards, but this is not a card you should prioritize."},{"CardName":"Foreboding Fruit","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Foreboding Fruit checks a few boxes for me. First of all, it helps smooth out draws when you play this early and makes sure you can hit your land drops. It also gives you back the life investment once you hit the adamant bonus, while also enabling your Food synergies. It can even target the opponent to finish them off, though you won’t be doing that very often."},{"CardName":"Forever Young","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like Forever Young–it cycles early, since you can cast it without targets, and later in the game can really load up the top of your deck with action. That’s a nice combination, and this even rewards both self-mill and the draw-2 deck."},{"CardName":"Foulmire Knight","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I really like the flexibility that Foulmire Knight provides. If you’re behind, it’s a 1/1 deathtouch for 1, which is solid. If you have a little time, you can go on an adventure first, and pick up a free card, making this a 2-for-1. It also works nicely with Raise Dead effects, and even counts for both Knight and non-Human synergies."},{"CardName":"Giant's Skewer","Rating":"1.0","Description":"As delicious as that boar looks, Giant’s Skewer is a little too slow and situational for my tastes. This is clunky to equip, and the opponent has control over your food production, which is never a situation you want to be in."},{"CardName":"Lash of Thorns","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Lash is a poor combat trick because it doesn’t give much of a toughness boost. Yes, you do take out their creature, but losing yours plus the Lash is not a good deal."},{"CardName":"Locthwain Paladin","Rating":"2.0","Description":"If you can reliably adamant this, I’m in. If not, this is overcosted by a full mana, which is not how I like my cards. They better be overcosted by at least three mana to make me happy."},{"CardName":"Lost Legion","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Lost Legion is a solid addition to any deck with 10+ black sources. It is below the bar on stats, but scry 2 makes up for it, and it is a Knight for the decks that care about such things."},{"CardName":"Malevolent Noble","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’d play this without any synergy bonuses, as it is a Grizzly Bear with a solid upside. Once you start generating a ton of Food or sacrificial fodder, the Noble goes up in value, but you don’t need much to want to play this given how high the floor is."},{"CardName":"Memory Theft","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I see this more as a sideboard card than a maindeck one, as it’s targeted at expensive cards and opponents with a lot of adventures. I’d also look to run it maindeck in Sealed, as you are likely to have plenty of good hits with it."},{"CardName":"Murderous Rider","Rating":"4.5","Description":"It doesn’t get much better than this. A powerful removal spell that is an intrinsic 2-for-1 is awesome, and the fact that you can cast both halves separately makes this insane. It also works exceedingly well with Raise Dead effects, which black is certainly poised to take advantage of."},{"CardName":"Oathsworn Knight","Rating":"3.5","Description":"If you give me a 4/4 creature for three mana that’s also very hard to kill, I will accept the drawback of needing to attack every turn. This even gets around deathtouch and can have its lifespan extended via equipment if needed."},{"CardName":"Order of Midnight","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Both halves of this are exactly what the doctor ordered. Early in the game, just run this out and bash with your 2/2 flier, and later in the game get max value. Order of Midnight being unable to block makes this less of a defensive play than something like Gravedigger, but on balance it’s better, and Gravedigger has been a marquee uncommon for a while."},{"CardName":"Piper of the Swarm","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Why settle for a Pack Rat when you can instead make a pack of Rats? OK, this isn’t quite as good as one of the best Limited cards of all time, but it’s still one of the better cards in the set. This makes a small army of 1/1 menace creatures, and once you have a couple in play, completely dominates the board with the steal ability. The only knock on it is that it takes a while to get going, so as a topdeck in the middle of the game it’s not quite bomb-level."},{"CardName":"Rankle, Master of Pranks","Rating":"4.5","Description":"A 3/3 flying haste for four would raise eyebrows, and adding three solid abilities takes this right to the top of the standings. There will be boards where you use all the abilities, or none, and everything in between. Given that you’re hitting them with a 3/3 flier, you often will want to make both players draw (since you’re pressuring their life total), though it does give them more outs to find removal. The discard ability is likely the least relevant, but there still will be times when it gives you an advantage. In all, it doesn’t rankle me to say that this is one of the best cards in the set."},{"CardName":"Reaper of Night","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Reaper of Night is better than it looks. Even though both halves are clunky (with the creature being especially so), it’s still a 3-for-1 that combines discard and a big “flier,” and I think this is going to perform well."},{"CardName":"Reave Soul","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Reave Soul is efficient, and will have plenty of targets to feast on. That said, it will miss on most of the cards you *really* want to kill, so it’s just a good removal spell instead of a great one."},{"CardName":"Revenge of Ravens","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Effects like this do tend to be better than they look, but I still think this card will only be good in a narrow subset of decks. If you are very controlling, this could buy you time, but in order to fully get value from this you will need to be pressuring the opponent as well. That’s an odd combination, and it won’t come together very often.\r\n\r\nRating Update 9/30: Effects like this in fact are better than they look. After seeing this in action, it’s disgusting, and makes attacking extremely hard for the opponent. The rating has gotten a significant bump, and I now think this is one of the better cards you can start with."},{"CardName":"Smitten Swordmaster","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Swordmaster (which actually has lifelink, unlike Silverflame Squire) is a fine play at most stages of the game, though I wouldn’t start getting excited about this until I was in a heavy Knight deck. This is one of the adventure cards where the creature gets cast first most of the time, so don’t stress if you aren’t getting full value."},{"CardName":"Specter's Shriek","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This is strictly a sideboard card, and not a great one at that. Unless your opponent’s deck is extremely weighted towards black, you run the risk of casting this and missing, which is a disaster."},{"CardName":"Syr Konrad, the Grim","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This does make the board quite grim for your opponent. No matter what they do, they are getting pinged for one, and often more. Syr Konrad is also large enough to brawl, and in the event that the board does stall, can start activating to drain the opponent out."},{"CardName":"Tempting Witch","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’d want some Food-based combos before I was tempted to play this, as by itself it’s not very impactful. The stats aren’t there and getting a poisoned food doesn’t do quite enough."},{"CardName":"Wicked Guardian","Rating":"2.0","Description":"In a deck with enough 3-toughness creatures, this is worth four mana. It’s not wicked good, but it is serviceable, and slightly ahead of the curve when it works."},{"CardName":"Wishclaw Talisman","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Wishclaw is a slow way to gain card advantage, and there’s some risk to it. If your opponent’s best card is amazing, they may just run you over, even though you get to search up two cards for their one. They also have the option of not giving it back, at which point you got a Demonic Tutor for three mana. That’s not spectacular, and all told this is a weird and somewhat mediocre card."},{"CardName":"Witch's Vengeance","Rating":"3.5","Description":"While there will be times that are awkward, where you and the opponent both have a bunch of Knights or the like, this acts as removal and sometimes will net you multiple cards. That makes it a solid removal spell, and one I don’t mind picking up early."},{"CardName":"Barge In","Rating":"1.5","Description":"An attacking-only combat trick with minor upside? Where do I sign up??"},{"CardName":"Bloodhaze Wolverine","Rating":"2.5","Description":"If you have zero ways to trigger this in your deck, it’s mediocre, but all it takes is a couple draw effects before this becomes a good 2-drop. Fun fact: Ben Stark learned that wolverines were real in 2017."},{"CardName":"Blow Your House Down","Rating":"1.0","Description":"As great as the flavor is here, I’m not looking to play this in my deck very often. When you do tend to want “can’t block” effects, you want them to hit all the creatures, not just three, though I do think this is a cute sideboard card against someone with multiple Walls."},{"CardName":"Bonecrusher Giant","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Bonecrusher Giant combines an undercosted creature with a decent burn spell, and you even get to choose if you want one or both. That’s a great deal, and one you’ll always be in for. Note that the damage prevention from Stomp makes it so that if their protection from white creature blocked a white creature, it can still die because protection will no longer prevent damage."},{"CardName":"Brimstone Trebuchet","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is a decent way to peck the opponent, and reach means that it can keep all sorts of pesky little creatures off your back. In a deck with plenty of Knights, this certainly gets better, but it’s playable even without that."},{"CardName":"Burning-Yard Trainer","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"If you reliably have a target for this, it comes across the table for a lot of damage. You will want to both be aggressive and have lots of Knights, so make sure those conditions are met."},{"CardName":"Claim the Firstborn","Rating":"1.5","Description":"There isn’t a ton of support for a RB sacrifice deck, though there are enough pieces that it will occasionally come together. While this may be priced to move for Constructed, not being able to steal big things is a bigger drawback than the bonus of this costing one, so I’m not excited about playing it."},{"CardName":"Crystal Slipper","Rating":"1.0","Description":"The effect here is so marginal that I’m loathe to include it any deck. Yes, when you draw the perfect ratio of lands and creatures, drawing exactly one card like the Slipper can be pretty good, but anytime your draw is off at all leads to a disaster."},{"CardName":"Embercleave","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Embercleave is one of the best cards in the set. If you are attacking with as few as two creatures, it’s trivial to cast this, and usually what will happen is that you’ll win a combat and they will take a bunch of damage, leaving you with a huge trampling double-striking threat. That’s insane, and the really nuts part is that even if they kill whatever is wielding this, you can just re-equip it and kill them with something else. This does so much damage and ends games extremely rapidly as a result. Don’t pass this, and consider switching to red if you open it in pack two."},{"CardName":"Embereth Paladin","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Embereth Paladin is a little fragile for my tastes, and even with adamant it is unlikely to survive combat. That makes it a marginal playable, though if you can get a hit in with this, it does deal quite a bit of damage out of nowhere."},{"CardName":"Embereth Shieldbreaker","Rating":"3.0","Description":"There are enough artifacts running around (or sitting around) to make this hit most of the time, and it’s efficient enough to be a good early play. Unless you know they have artifacts, I would usually just play this on turn two instead of doing nothing, though if they have something like a good piece of equipment, you may want to save it."},{"CardName":"Ferocity of the Wilds","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Like Crystal Slipper, this will impress when it slots in perfectly with a bunch of non-Human creatures, but in a creature-light draw it’s just way too costly to be worth it."},{"CardName":"Fervent Champion","Rating":"1.0","Description":"In an extremely dedicated Knights deck that also has some good equipment, feel free to run this. Otherwise, it just attacks and dies without making much of an impact. Sorry, Javier–I’m sure you’ll get your time in the sun in Constructed."},{"CardName":"Fires of Invention","Rating":"0.0","Description":"As much as I have the fire for this in Constructed (Time Warp beckons in Modern), this is a stone blank in Limited. Without doing fancy things, this does way too little to be worth a card."},{"CardName":"Fling","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The lack of a good Act of Treason really limits Fling, so I mostly see this as a finisher in a deck that has a ton of creatures (well, I mostly see this as a marginal playable, but if you *were* to play it, that would be why)."},{"CardName":"Irencrag Feat","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Like Fires of Invention, this is not a card geared towards Limited. It’s too hard to cast, and by the time you can cast it, there’s no guarantee you’ll even have something big to drop."},{"CardName":"Irencrag Pyromancer","Rating":"2.0 // 4.0","Description":"This is the rare build-around that starts high and gets even higher if you put the work in. Granted, if you have literally zero ways to draw extra cards, this isn’t playable, but it’s decent with even one or two cantrips. Once you have 4+, it becomes a machine gun, and can ravage the opponent’s forces with ease. Plus, it even blocks well, which is a nice bonus."},{"CardName":"Joust","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Joust is a very good removal spell in a Knights deck, and a marginal inclusion otherwise. I’d prioritize this at 3-4 Knights, and windmill slam it at 6+. There are enough Knights that this will basically always make the cut, and is worth taking early."},{"CardName":"Mad Ratter","Rating":"1.0 // 3.5","Description":"If you can get this going, it will overwhelm the opponent in a tide of Rats. It’s a build-around worth working towards, and I’d be happy taking this early and trying to pick up a bunch of cantrips."},{"CardName":"Merchant of the Vale","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m a big fan of Merchant of the Vale. It does a good job filtering through cards by itself, and once you start factoring combos like the draw-2 cards, it becomes a critical part of your deck. Plus, it can brawl if needed, making it an all-around good card."},{"CardName":"Ogre Errant","Rating":"2.5","Description":"If you need a big dumb animal, here you go. Ogre Errant would probably smush me into the ground for saying that, so I’ll show myself out before that happens. You don’t need other Knights for this to be playable, but it helps, and I especially like the combo with Embereth Paladin."},{"CardName":"Opportunistic Dragon","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Unless you have sacrifice effects, this Dragon essentially exiles whatever it’s taken until the opponent slays the Dragon. That ability on a 4/3 flier for four is fantastic, and this is a huge beating at any stage in the game."},{"CardName":"Raging Redcap","Rating":"2.5","Description":"There is plenty of equipment in the set, and this conveniently is a Knight, so it’s easy to make Raging Redcap overperform. That said, if you have zero pump spells, this isn’t quite good enough."},{"CardName":"Redcap Melee","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Redcap Melee is a very cool “sideboard” card. I use quotes because this one in particular is worth maindecking–at worst you sacrifice a land, which makes it a fine lategame removal spell. If you do kill a red creature, it’s super-efficient, and either way I’m taking this card early and always running it."},{"CardName":"Redcap Raiders","Rating":"2.0","Description":"If you have enough non-Humans to reliably pump this, it’s a decent attacker. It isn’t a great defender, and without help is puny, so make sure it’s got backup."},{"CardName":"Rimrock Knight","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Rimrock Knight gives you a cheap curve filler and a marginal combat trick, which is actually fine in combination. You will end up feeling pretty good when you use this to trade your 2/2 for a 4/4, as getting the 3/1 later more than makes up for the card disadvantage."},{"CardName":"Robber of the Rich","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Robber of the Rich tells the tale of Robin Hood quite nicely (and that’s why it’s an archer with reach). This nets you a card most times it attacks, and doesn’t even need to survive in order for you to play the card. It also technically lets you use other Rogues to play those exiled cards later, though there aren’t tons more of those in the set. This card has a lot of text, but it’s all upside, and overall this plays like a 2/2 that draws a card when it attacks. That’s very good (though it can’t play lands off their deck), and I’d be happy with this in any red deck."},{"CardName":"Scorching Dragonfire","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Shockingly (or should I say strikingly), the 3-damage spell for two mana is a good card. Carry on."},{"CardName":"Searing Barrage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Five mana for five damage is serviceable, as we’ve seen before, and sometimes this’ll clip the opponent for an extra three damage. That works for me."},{"CardName":"Seven Dwarves","Rating":"1.5 // 7.0","Description":"That’s 1.5 out of 7.0, just to be clear, because this card is not good. Sure, sometimes you will want a 2/2 for 2, and even more rarely you’ll draw two of these at once, but don’t think this is a quest worth going on. Amusingly, the text overwrites the game rules, so even in Limited you can’t play more than seven of these."},{"CardName":"Skullknocker Ogre","Rating":"1.5","Description":"A 4/3 for four is all well and good, but the effect here is a disadvantage. The opponent getting to randomly loot lets them stock up lands and try and cash them in, plus they get to control when they get hit to a degree, which means you are less likely to get the trigger when their hand is good."},{"CardName":"Slaying Fire","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is a little better than Scorching Dragonfire in heavy red decks, as dealing four and going to the face is great, but either way you’ll be happy with whichever burn spell you end up on."},{"CardName":"Sundering Stroke","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Seven mana may be a lot, but guess what–so is seven damage. This is a funny card because it’s highly splashable as a finisher/sweeper, while also being insane in mono-red. I’m in to, uh, sunder my opponents, and like that you can take this early and potentially splash it if you don’t end up in red."},{"CardName":"Syr Carah, the Bold","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Syr Carah feeds you a steady stream of cards if left unchecked, and at worst can ping the opponent’s creatures. Not that this effect does let you play lands, since half of these don’t, and you just have to read them to see which does which."},{"CardName":"Thrill of Possibility","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I was always fine running a Tormenting Voice in my decks, and this working with a set mechanic (the draw-2 theme) and being an instant just makes it that much better."},{"CardName":"Torbran, Thane of Red Fell","Rating":"3.0 // 4.0","Description":"In a heavy red deck, this is an excellent card. It acts as a 4/4 while buffing the rest of your team, and even makes your spells deal more damage. In a two-color deck, it’s harder to cast and does less, so the rating drops a bit."},{"CardName":"Weaselback Redcap","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Goblin-riding-a-weasel equity aside, this is a card that takes too much mana to effectively use. I don’t want to spend two mana to make my 1-drop trade for their 2-drop, so this is best left in the sideboard."},{"CardName":"Beanstalk Giant","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Some of the adventure cards really feel like two peas in a pod, and this card is certainly one of them. Fertile Footsteps gets you right where you need to be to cast Beanstalk Giant, and the Giant takes things from there. This is a great addition to any deck, and even helps splash in a set that’s not very conducive to such things."},{"CardName":"Curious Pair","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Most decks are going to have some sort of food synergy at the ready, so this pair will make the cut more often than not. If you have zero ways to use Food and aren’t lacking early defense, leave these in the woods and move on."},{"CardName":"Edgewall Innkeeper","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Given that this is a 1/1 dork, you’ll want to draw two cards off it before calling it a win. That’s not too hard to accomplish, and if you take this early you can usually end up with the 6-7 adventures needed to make it a hit."},{"CardName":"Feasting Troll King","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Feasting Troll King is a beating. Your opponent has to kill it twice unless they have exile or aura-based removal, and the second time you don’t even have to pay mana to bring it back. Plus, if you assemble enough Food, this comes back for a third helping, as Trolls are wont to do. The combination of vigilance and trample also means that the opponent can’t chump or ignore this, and there aren’t many ways to deal with it to begin with. As far as giant green monsters go, this is at the top of the heap."},{"CardName":"Fell the Pheasant","Rating":"1.0","Description":"As usual, the “kill a flier” card is sideboard material. It is nice that this gives you a bit of a bonus when it works, making it even that much more appealing to knock their stuff out of the air."},{"CardName":"Fierce Witchstalker","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m loving the trend of green getting sick midrange beaters at common. We all know that green isn’t going to get the best removal spell or a great flier, so having their wheelhouse be 4-mana 4/4’s with upside sounds good to me. This not only brings Food to the table, it also tramples, making it an awesome 4-mana play."},{"CardName":"Flaxen Intruder","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m not loving either side of this card. The 1/2 creature is too anemic to really do much, and seven mana is asking a lot for a trio of bears. The recipe of cheap spell + expensive creature is a lot better of an adventure than cheap creature + expensive spell, since the order you cast them in matters."},{"CardName":"Garenbrig Carver","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This guy hasn’t exactly carved out a niche for himself, as both the combat trick and the creature are the height of mediocrity. Still, getting both those effects in one card is tempting, and this can fill out a deck that’s short playables (or combat tricks), while being a solid card in an adventure-based deck."},{"CardName":"Garenbrig Paladin","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Garenbrig Paladin is a decent option for your 5-drop slot, and if you can reliably make it into a 5/5, you’ll be pretty happy with how it performs. The evasion ability helps prevent chump blocks and double blocks, and this is big enough to brawl all the creatures that can block it. Don’t prioritize this, but you’ll play the first copy more often than not."},{"CardName":"Garenbrig Squire","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is the 2-drop the adventure deck wants, and even in a deck that isn’t fully dedicated, this can hit for three every now and then. That’s enough upside on this Grizzly Bear to make it a decent option, and in some decks it’ll be quite good."},{"CardName":"Giant Opportunity","Rating":"1.0","Description":"You aren’t going to get too many opportunities to grow an early giant, as two Food tokens isn’t the easiest to assemble, and making 3 Food tokens for three mana is definitely not good enough. That makes this too inconsistent, and only good in the most dedicated Food decks."},{"CardName":"Gilded Goose","Rating":"4.0","Description":"The starting point here is great, as 1-mana accelerators are fantastic. This does only tap once before it needs to make some more fuel, but that first mana is the most important, and this has relevant abilities in the lategame. That combination makes this a very good card, even if it doesn’t look like most bomb rares."},{"CardName":"The Great Henge","Rating":"4.5","Description":"All you need is a 4/4 and this becomes eminently castable, after which you will run away with the game in as little as a turn. All your creatures being bigger and coming with an extra card is incredibly hard to beat, and the 2 life a turn that this provides makes it very difficult for your opponent to kill you before you bury them in cards. That’s a deal I’m in for, and The Great Henge is one of the best cards in the set as a result."},{"CardName":"Insatiable Appetite","Rating":"1.5","Description":"My appetite for combat tricks is extremely satiable, as I’m full after one, or sometimes even zero. If you need something to win combats with, this will do that, but it’s not an engine worth building around."},{"CardName":"Keeper of Fables","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Keeper of Fables is the real deal–it puts a large body on to the board and provides you with a steady stream of cards. It’s not hard to play this and immediately get a card out of it, at which point you’re playing with house money."},{"CardName":"Kenrith's Transformation","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Aha, I’ve figured out how to get me to like a card that turns something into a creature–put “draw a card” on it. Even though the recipient here ends up being large still, this replacing itself makes it worth including in your deck, as downgrading their bombs is a great deal. You can also slap this on one of your small creatures, as it can serve as a pump spell of sorts."},{"CardName":"Lovestruck Beast","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Lovestruck Beast hits hard and comes out early, and even gives you an extra token. Granted, that token probably shouldn’t get into combat, but if you need to, it’s there. Note that this can block just fine without a 1/1, making it a solid defensive body no matter what."},{"CardName":"Maraleaf Rider","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Green has no shortage of mediocre playables, and Maraleaf Rider is one of them. Maraleaf Rider pressures the opponent well enough, and can trade itself plus a Food Token for one of their creatures, but is fragile enough that I’m not excited to play it."},{"CardName":"Oakhame Adversary","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Even if the opponent isn’t playing green, this is a beating. It demands blocking, thanks to the draw trigger, and a 2/3 deathtouch can be really hard to beat in combat. Plus, sometimes they are green, and you get to slam this on turn two and win the game easily."},{"CardName":"Once and Future","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Once and Future is slow, and without the adamant, largely not worth the mana spent on it. If you are getting two cards back (at the cost of a draw step), it can swing the game enough to make it a playable."},{"CardName":"Once Upon a Time","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I normally am not a huge fan of this kind of card. Paying a couple mana to smooth out your draws isn’t what I want to be doing, and not many of your creatures are worth spending extra mana finding. However, getting to play this free if it’s in your opening hand is really big, and makes me interested in running Once Upon a Time as a way to make my draws more consistent."},{"CardName":"Outmuscle","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Hunting the weak never felt so good, as this can sometimes ensure that your creature is not losing the fight. It also lets you attack after fighting, which is a nice way to get some extra damage in."},{"CardName":"Questing Beast","Rating":"4.5","Description":"It slices, it dices, it attacks for four. Questing Beast is a ton of keywords and a few good abilities, both for Limited and Standard, all for the bargain price of four mana. Unsurprisingly, packing that much stuff onto a card makes it good, and this is just a beating at any point in the game."},{"CardName":"Return of the Wildspeaker","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Return of the Wildspeaker being an instant makes it a lot more exciting than most Overrun effects, as your opponent often won’t block with it in mind. It also has the fallback of drawing you a couple cards, making this good when you go wide or go big, if you have some creatures in play."},{"CardName":"Return to Nature","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This is naturally a sideboard card, and a solid one at that, given how many auras are in the set."},{"CardName":"Rosethorn Acolyte","Rating":"3.0","Description":"While the adventure part is mostly a throwaway, this is a good 3-drop and a way to fix your colors while ramping you. That’s a good deal in my book."},{"CardName":"Rosethorn Halberd","Rating":"1.5","Description":"You get the first taste for free, but subsequent ones will really cost you. That’s enough to make the cut in an aggressive deck, though not quite enough for midrange and definitely not good enough in a control deck."},{"CardName":"Sporecap Spider","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Defensive green decks will be happy playing 1-2 of these, and aggressive green decks will avoid this like the plague."},{"CardName":"Syr Faren, the Hengehammer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Syr Faren knows how to party. This drives a green beatdown deck almost by itself and is especially effective with combat tricks or equipment."},{"CardName":"Tall as a Beanstalk","Rating":"1.0","Description":"The best use I can think of for this is out of the sideboard against a deck that can’t kill a 5/5 or 6/6 very easily. That’s pretty narrow."},{"CardName":"Trail of Crumbs","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"This is a decent engine if you can generate enough Food, especially since you gain 3 life every time you go through the process. That can overwhelm the opponent in cards, and presumably the Trail of Crumbs leads to more Food cards so you can keep going."},{"CardName":"Tuinvale Treefolk","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This is yet another mediocre green card, as it provides a weak pump effect plus a clunky creature. It’s certainly playable, but definitely not exciting."},{"CardName":"Wicked Wolf","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Even without food, this is a 3/3 that eats a 2/2 or smaller when it comes into play. That’s very good, and once you add in some provisions it becomes downright scary. I’d try to get some Food if I had this in my deck, but part of the strength of the card is that it does just fine without any help."},{"CardName":"Wildborn Preserver","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Flash on this is a bit strange, but the card is so good that I can overlook it. All it takes is you playing one creature and this becomes huge, and two or more creatures makes it massive. You get to dump all your mana into it, and it even has reach in case you need to defend against fliers. This doesn’t look a normal bomb, but it really is that good."},{"CardName":"Wildwood Tracker","Rating":"1.5","Description":"In the non-Human beatdown deck, which is getting pushed pretty hard here, this is a good way to curve out. In a deck that isn’t attacking and/or doesn’t have enough non-Humans, this is about as bad as it gets."},{"CardName":"Wolf's Quarry","Rating":"1.0","Description":"The wolf picked poorly, as it’s chasing down one of the least playable cards in the set. This just costs too much mana, and even if you want the Food, you have to wait to get it."},{"CardName":"Yorvo, Lord of Garenbrig","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Yorvo is a giant beating, and in a mono-green deck, is an easy first pick. Outside of mono-green, he is a bit clunkier, as he really wants to come down before the rest of your squad. I also enjoy the measuring contest he puts on, and it’s pretty unlikely that he ever loses."},{"CardName":"Dance of the Manse","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Dance of the Manse has no chance. It can’t get back Auras, it’s way too situational, and getting the actual good benefit costs tons of mana."},{"CardName":"Doom Foretold","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Doom Foretold is powerful, but looks to be hard to use. It affects both players, so once they sacrifice something and pass back, you then also have to sac something, which can include Doom Foretold (at which point it just dies and doesn’t trigger). If you have ways to break the symmetry, like cheap creatures that aren’t tokens, this can be profitable, though the best case is probably just trying to sneak this in when they don’t have anything in play. Either way, this is clunky and often won’t deliver, so I want to see it in action before being convinced."},{"CardName":"Drown in the Loch","Rating":"2.5","Description":"By itself, Drown is a lategame answer, as it’ll take until the midgame at least for their graveyard to fill up. That is playable, even if sometimes it’ll rot in your hand early. However, once you start milling them, this just becomes the perfect answer, so it goes up quite a bit in a deck that is trying to do that."},{"CardName":"Escape to the Wilds","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Escape to the Wilds is a bigger version of Light up the Stage. I see Escape to the Wilds as something akin to a draw 3.5 / 4. You get to play this, play a land, and then next turn play another land plus 1-2 spells, depending on costs. It’s not good with situational cards, like combat tricks, but in a normal RG deck you can reasonably expect to get two lands plus 1-2 spells as a result of this. That’s good enough for me, and it even gets better the lower your curve is."},{"CardName":"Faeburrow Elder","Rating":"3.5","Description":"A 3-mana 2/2 that taps for two mana is well above the curve, and this sometimes even does more than that. Faeburrow Elder will let you run over any opponent when drawn early, and even late can give you the mana to make some big plays."},{"CardName":"Garruk, Cursed Huntsman","Rating":"5.0","Description":"It doesn’t get much better than this. Garruk, Cursed Huntsman heavily impacts the board with two Wolves a turn, gains loyalty when they die, and can even kill fliers or big creatures that are threatening him. Plus, his ultimate is quite cheap, and may make it so your opponent can’t kill the Wolves he makes out of fear of it. Garruk, Cursed Huntsman is the best card in Throne of Eldraine."},{"CardName":"Grumgully, the Generous","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Grumgully is generous indeed. You don’t have to do much to make this 5/5 or 6/6 worth of stats over the course of a game, and given that the floor is a Centaur Courser, I’m in."},{"CardName":"Improbable Alliance","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I really like Improbable Alliance. It is a build-around, but it’s so easy to make work that most decks should just play it regardless, especially given that it self-fuels in the lategame. If you start with this in a draft, the draw-2 deck is exactly where you want to go, and will reward you richly if you get there."},{"CardName":"Inspiring Veteran","Rating":"3.0 // 3.5","Description":"In a baseline RW deck, this will be great. Once you go super deep on Knights, it gets even better, and is a low-cost high-impact card overall."},{"CardName":"Lochmere Serpent","Rating":"4.5","Description":"This is a loch to be first-picked, as it’s a huge flash beater that not only can attack unblockably, can cycle your Swamps if you’re flooded. Oh yeah, it also comes back from the graveyard if they do somehow kill it…"},{"CardName":"Maraleaf Pixie","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The Pixie is an efficient attacker or a good mana accelerant, whichever the game demands. That works for me, and this is a card I wouldn’t mind kicking off a draft with."},{"CardName":"Oko, Thief of Crowns","Rating":"5.0","Description":"Garruk may have the crown when it comes to best card in the set (for Limited), but Oko isn’t far behind. He doesn’t steal games as much as just dominate them from the get-go, as I’m sure we will see all too often in Standard. If you play Oko and +2, the opponent is unlikely to be able to kill him, and you can then either make a 3/3 or potentially yoink their creature. Those two abilities on a cheap planeswalker with super high loyalty is absurd, and Oko is almost unbeatable on turn three (while being just very good later)."},{"CardName":"Outlaws' Merriment","Rating":"4.5","Description":"You get to spin the wheel every turn, but this is one of those good prize wheels that has all winners. No matter what you get, you’ll be happy, and at four mana, this is quite a deal. Sure, sometimes you’ll need a specific hit to win, but most games you’ll just play this and run the opponent over in a matter of turns."},{"CardName":"The Royal Scions","Rating":"4.5","Description":"These planeswalkers don’t mess around, do they? The Royal Scions don’t have a huge impact on the board, at least not defensively, but have such a high loyalty that you’ll get tons of value from them. They enable the draw-2 deck and let you find whatever you’re looking for, all while threatening an ultimate that just ends the game."},{"CardName":"Savvy Hunter","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Savvy Hunter is a great deal. She comes in for cheap, starts generating Food quickly, and for no mana, can cash in Food for cards. This working with other Food cards is just a bonus, as this is an excellent card even in isolation."},{"CardName":"Shinechaser","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"In a deck with plenty of support, this is a good flying threat. It really does need to be a 3/3 to really shine, so try and aim for 4-5 cards of each type if you want this to be awesome."},{"CardName":"Steelclaw Lance","Rating":"3.5","Description":"In a Knights deck, this is a savagely undercosted equipment. In a deck that has a mix of creatures, it’s still quite good, and in a deck with zero Knights it falls off pretty hard. Overall, that makes this a great card, as +2/+2 for a one mana equip cost is a huge deal."},{"CardName":"Stormfist Crusader","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’d always play Stormfist Crusader in an aggressive or midrange deck, but the draw card ability isn’t what control decks are looking for. Basically, you want to be pressuring the opponent’s life total to really get value here, and a 2/2 menace is good at that, so make sure it has support."},{"CardName":"Wandermare","Rating":"3.0 // 3.5","Description":"In a heavy adventure deck, this can go off quickly, and it’s a solid beast of burden even without too many enablers. That’s a fine place to be, and this will wander into my deck often."},{"CardName":"Wintermoor Commander","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Wintermoor Commander is playable if you’re in BW, but unlike most of these gold cards, isn’t a reason to be in that combo. It will usually just serve as a 2/1 or 2/2 deathtouch, and getting much more out of it is a challenge."},{"CardName":"Arcanist's Owl","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Note: For all the hybrid cards, I’m rating them assuming you are mono-color or in their two colors, and therefore they are easy to cast. They largely shouldn’t go in 2-color decks that aren’t of their two colors.\r\n\r\nI love Arcanist’s Owl. It’s a 3/3 flier for four that also finds a good card, and UW often ends up with 5+ hits even without trying. If you are light on goodies to find, the rating drops, but in a well-enabled deck this is truly excellent."},{"CardName":"Covetous Urge","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Taking a turn off to cast this can be rough, though it’s quite powerful if you do have the time. Remember that you can take a card from their graveyard if need be, which makes this a lot better lategame than it would be otherwise."},{"CardName":"Deathless Knight","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Deathless Knight is really annoying to play against, which is usually the sign of a good card. It keeps the pressure on, meaning they can’t ignore it, and when it trades off it comes back easily. That’s a great threat for any Food deck, and it can also block well if you are on the backfoot."},{"CardName":"Elite Headhunter","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Elite Headhunter is the worst of the bunch here, as it’s a little too small and its ability is a little too expensive. If you can cobble together a sacrifice deck, this does play well in it, but that won’t happen too often."},{"CardName":"Fireborn Knight","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is a beating. The pump ability makes it very hard to block when you have your mana up, and at some point you might just start whacking them for 6-8 a turn. It also plays well with pump spells and equipment, which aren’t hard to find in these parts."},{"CardName":"Loch Dragon","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Loch Dragon isn’t the biggest creature of them all, but it provides you with a steady stream of cards. If this is attacking unopposed, you will rip through your deck rapidly, and all your draw-2 cards will be on as well."},{"CardName":"Oakhame Ranger","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If Oakhame Ranger sticks, it’s going to dominate the board. It is more vulnerable to removal than most of this cycle, since it provides no effect right away, but you can mitigate that by taking the slow route and getting your tokens first."},{"CardName":"Rampart Smasher","Rating":"3.5","Description":"HULK SMASH! I’m in for this, as a 5/5 for four with upside is always going to be a great deal."},{"CardName":"Resolute Rider","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is classic threat of activation material, as the opponent will fear blocking it and you don’t have to waste your mana protecting it. It also can start going down the lifelink path if need be, making it very difficult to race."},{"CardName":"Thunderous Snapper","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Hexplate Golem jokes aside, this is a great 4-drop. If you get even one card out of it, you made out like a bandit, and it’s a brawler just by itself. I’d snap this up early if you see it, as it’s a very good reason to be in these colors.\r\n\r\nArtifacts and Lands are all that’s left, and they will be following shortly. Enjoy the prerelease!\r\n\r\nLSV"},{"CardName":"Clockwork Servant","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m happy playing this in any deck with 10-11 sources of a color, as it’s a fine play even a little bit off curve. In a deck that’s got a 9-8 split, I’d avoid it, but it’s worth working towards and adjusting your manabase."},{"CardName":"Crashing Drawbridge","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I like the Walls in this set. They are both defensive and offensive, and thus serve a purpose even if you’re the aggressor. Crashing Drawbridge helps pressure the opponent nicely, and can play defense if needed."},{"CardName":"Enchanted Carriage","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Enchanted Carriage is both a flavor and gameplay win, as it gives you a lot of stats and multiple creatures. Even though this is a vehicle, it barely has a drawback, as it comes with its own crew."},{"CardName":"Gingerbrute","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This card is sweet, but don’t be too hasty. I’d want to either be super aggressive or have a lot of artifact/food synergies before this made the cut."},{"CardName":"Golden Egg","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Golden Egg is a fairly low-cost card to put in your deck, and it helps smooth out draws, fix mana, and trigger artifact/food synergies. That’s enough for me, and it even helps out the draw-2 deck, making it a versatile enabler."},{"CardName":"Henge Walker","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"In a mono-color deck, this is fine. In any deck with a split manabase, it’s basically unplayable."},{"CardName":"Heraldic Banner","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’d want 8+ creatures of the same color before I played this, and ideally even more. It’s a weird mix of mana accelerant/fixer and go-wide reward, so most decks aren’t going to want both effects."},{"CardName":"Inquisitive Puppet","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’d be lying if I said this was an impactful card, and the truth is that most games it won’t quite pull its weight."},{"CardName":"Jousting Dummy","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Unless you really need a Knight in battered armor, or are criminally short on 2-drops, I’d leave this on the sidelines. I won’t call you a dummy for playing it, because that would be mean, but it really isn’t good."},{"CardName":"Locthwain Gargoyle","Rating":"1.0","Description":"As cool as I find the concept of gargoyles to be, this is too much mana to pump, and as such should not make the cut."},{"CardName":"Lucky Clover","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"I wonder what it’s like to be lucky? If you get this and 4+ adventures, you too can discover that, and it’s especially great with adventures that make tokens or kill creatures. This is a powerful build-around, and right now I’d be inclined to take it early."},{"CardName":"Prophet of the Peak","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If you need a six-drop, here you go. This is clunky enough that it’s not a high priority, but it does do its job."},{"CardName":"Roving Keep","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I love me a Hexplate Golem, and this is like a bigger and better version. In reality, this isn’t abysmal, as it is a big closer if you’re completely lacking in such. Just watch out, as Blow Your House Down is a huge beating against this."},{"CardName":"Scalding Cauldron","Rating":"2.5","Description":"You’ll end up playing this most of the time, as it does get things dead. It is a little inefficient, and it sits on the board (so there are no surprises coming), but removal is removal."},{"CardName":"Shambling Suit","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Even though this looks like an artifact/enchantment payoff, it’s almost more of an enabler. You play this in decks looking to up your count of those cards, and get a side benefit of sometimes getting a 3/3 for 3."},{"CardName":"Signpost Scarecrow","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’d rather not play this in my deck, but it’s passable if you want a little color fixing and an extra artifact."},{"CardName":"Sorcerer's Broom","Rating":"1.5","Description":"As amusing as it would be to assemble an army of brooms, this is too expensive to really be worth investing in."},{"CardName":"Sorcerous Spyglass","Rating":"0.5","Description":"Save this one for Constructed. I’d board this in against something like Garruk or Oko, but otherwise not."},{"CardName":"Spinning Wheel","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like when my mana rocks do extra things, and the Wheel is a great example. This fixes your mana early and starts tapping things down late, which I’m definitely in for."},{"CardName":"Stonecoil Serpent","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Stonecoil Serpent is insane. It is undercosted at any point in the curve, except maybe as a 2/2 or 1/1, and it even has a bunch of extra abilities for your trouble. Plus, it’s colorless, so this will always make your deck."},{"CardName":"Weapon Rack","Rating":"1.0","Description":"These weapons don’t come cheap, and I’m not interested in paying four mana to slowly get three +1/+1 counters."},{"CardName":"Witch's Oven","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Unless you’re going super hard on the Food deck, this is not how you want to spend your resources."},{"CardName":"Castle Ardenvale","Rating":"3.5","Description":"All these castles provide a meaningful advantage out of a land, which is almost a 2 for 1 to start with (since the land functions as a mana source already). All of them are good early picks, and make your deck better without using a spell slot."},{"CardName":"Castle Vantress","Rating":"3.5","Description":"All these castles provide a meaningful advantage out of a land, which is almost a 2 for 1 to start with (since the land functions as a mana source already). All of them are good early picks, and make your deck better without using a spell slot."},{"CardName":"Castle Locthwain","Rating":"3.5","Description":"All these castles provide a meaningful advantage out of a land, which is almost a 2 for 1 to start with (since the land functions as a mana source already). All of them are good early picks, and make your deck better without using a spell slot."},{"CardName":"Castle Garenbrig","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The same applies to these two, but their effects are a little weaker, so the grades go down."},{"CardName":"Castle Embereth","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The same applies to these two, but their effects are a little weaker, so the grades go down."},{"CardName":"Dwarven Mine","Rating":"3.0","Description":"These lands are all nice value-adds, and worth taking above similarly rated playables once you’re in their colors. You aren’t going to be short on cards, and once again, these get extra value into your deck."},{"CardName":"Gingerbread Cabin","Rating":"3.0","Description":"These lands are all nice value-adds, and worth taking above similarly rated playables once you’re in their colors. You aren’t going to be short on cards, and once again, these get extra value into your deck."},{"CardName":"Idyllic Grange","Rating":"3.0","Description":"These lands are all nice value-adds, and worth taking above similarly rated playables once you’re in their colors. You aren’t going to be short on cards, and once again, these get extra value into your deck."},{"CardName":"Witch's Cottage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"These lands are all nice value-adds, and worth taking above similarly rated playables once you’re in their colors. You aren’t going to be short on cards, and once again, these get extra value into your deck."},{"CardName":"Mystic Sanctuary","Rating":"3.0","Description":"These lands are all nice value-adds, and worth taking above similarly rated playables once you’re in their colors. You aren’t going to be short on cards, and once again, these get extra value into your deck."},{"CardName":"Fabled Passage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"You’ll always play this in a 2+ color deck, and it will make it a little bit more consistent. It’s not a high pick, but it’s a nice addition.,"},{"CardName":"Tournament Grounds","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I wouldn’t play this unless I had a ton of Knights, and even then it’s not great until you’re playing all 3 colors. It just acts as a colorless land for too many of your cards, which is a huge drawback."}],"TopCommonCardsByColor":{"W":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Faerie Guidemother"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Flutterfox"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Silverflame Squire"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Ardenvale Tactician"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Trapped in the Tower"}],"U":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Moonlit Scavengers"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Queen of Ice"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Tome Raider"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Opt"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Charmed Sleep"}],"B":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Foreboding Fruit"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Barrow Witches"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Forever Young"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Reave Soul"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Bake into a Pie"}],"R":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Bloodhaze Wolverine"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Thrill of Possibility"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Raging Redcap"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Merchant of the Vale"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Scorching Dragonfire"}],"G":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Garenbrig Squire"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Curious Pair"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Outmuscle"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Rosethorn Acolyte"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Fierce Witchstalker"}]}},"M20":{"Ratings":[{"CardName":"Aerial Assault","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The biggest drawback to Aerial Assault is that you often got hit by whatever creature you killed with this, making it a painful piece of removal. The kicker on this mitigates that and adds up if you reliably have a couple fliers in play. I normally only want one of these types of cards in my deck, but Aerial Assault in a fliers deck is something I’m open to play multiple copies of."},{"CardName":"Ajani, Strength of the Pride","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Ajani goes off quickly if your opponent can’t attack him, as the play pattern of -2, -2, +1 leaves you with a bunch of very angry kitties. Even if your opponent does have a way to pressure Ajani, you can just +1 him and gain a bunch of life while upping his loyalty. That makes Ajani good when ahead, good in a race, and only bad when every far behind, but even then you get a creature that costs 2 and a couple life points. Ajani may not be the most flashy planeswalker, but is definitely a strong one."},{"CardName":"Ancestral Blade","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I love these designs, as they play quite nicely. Ancestral Blade starts as a 2/2 for 2, which is a fine deal, and it leaves behind a Leonin Scimitar when it dies. That’s a lot of value for just two mana, as a +1/+1 equipment with equip 1 is more relevant than you might think and having that be a kicker on a bear is just good value."},{"CardName":"Angel of Vitality","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Fliers are even better than normal in this set, as there are multiple rewards for having them. That makes a 2W 2/2 flier a card you’ll basically always play, and the lifegain incentives are a nice bonus on top of that. I wouldn’t go hard on lifegain because of Angel of Vitality, but if things line up then this could give you a few extra life and maybe even become a 4/4."},{"CardName":"Angelic Gift","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The way cards like this usually work is that they seem good, but you rarely actually have room for them. This replaces itself right away, and even gives a small bonus, but once you add up all your creatures and removal, you often are out of slots."},{"CardName":"Apostle of Purifying Light","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m wary of how protection will play in Limited, as I’ve had plenty of bad experiences in the past, though that’s more of a play pattern concern than a lack of power. In fact, I would always maindeck Apostle, as a 2/1 for 2 is passable against non-black decks, and when you do run into a black deck, this can just dominate the game. They can’t kill it with black removal, this can block ground creatures with impunity, and it gets in for free damage if they only have black blockers. The graveyard hate part isn’t particularly relevant, but it’s free, so might as well."},{"CardName":"Battalion Foot Soldier","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The sweet spot for Battalion Foot Soldier is three, though I’d play up to four without issue. White has good rewards for going wide in almost every color pair, and a flood of 2/2’s is generally going to be effective in Core Set drafts regardless. I don’t mind speculating on the first one of these early, though if you notice copies aren’t wheeling, it may be time to get out of the foot soldier game."},{"CardName":"Bishop of Wings","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"It’s not often that you have a ton of Angels in your deck, and if you do, your deck is probably busted. Bishop of Wings is big enough that it’s worth playing with as few as three Angels, though I’d want four or five to be happy. Also, this card sounds like the guy distributing Red Bull at their upcoming tournaments, which I view as upside."},{"CardName":"Brought Back","Rating":"1.0","Description":"It’s going to be rare to get an actual two-for-one with Brought Back, though a big combat step could do it. I’d view this more to bring back one creature when it dies, which at WW doesn’t quite do it for me."},{"CardName":"Cavalier of Dawn","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Cavalier of Dawn is a wild combination of abilities, as Beast Within + Argivian Find isn’t the most intuitive, but it’s still a giant monster with multiple good triggers attached. A 4/6 Vigilance is worth five mana (though triple white is a little rough), and killing their best permanent plus getting back a stray Pacifism or the like makes this good value both coming and going."},{"CardName":"Dawning Angel","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I have this on my list as one of the toughest cards to beat out of the Fliers deck, as multiple Dawning Angels make it really hard to race. The main flaw with 3/2 fliers is that they aren’t great defensively, and the four life really mitigates that. I’m high on Dawning Angel and will be happy to snap up as many as I can get."},{"CardName":"Daybreak Chaplain","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Daybreak Chaplain loses a little luster in a set without a lifegain theme (or with an extremely minor one), though it does fill out your curve if you need 2-drops. It gets a little better with pump spells too, even if aggressive decks aren’t really into 1/3’s."},{"CardName":"Devout Decree","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Unlike Apostle of Purifying Light, I wouldn’t maindeck Devout Decree. It’s just too bad when the opponent doesn’t have targets, as it’s a stone-blank, so keep this in the board. It is an effective sideboard card, so I don’t mind taking it early, as having cards that are this efficient is valuable, even if you only get to board them in some of the time."},{"CardName":"Disenchant","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Disenchant is a strictly sideboard card, and a classic one at that."},{"CardName":"Eternal Isolation","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’m fine maindecking Eternal Isolation as most opponents will have a couple targets, though be aware that you should side it out if they don’t present any in game one. I like how efficient this is, as you are almost always trading up on mana significantly."},{"CardName":"Fencing Ace","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Fencing Ace is just a glorified 2/1 until you pump it up, at which point it becomes a real beast. It’s a replacement-level 2-drop in decks without pump spells, and a great card if you have a few ways to buff its power."},{"CardName":"Gauntlets of Light","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m not sure what this is trying to do, but I’m not buying it. Giving a creature +2/+2 (or so) and an expensive untap ability is not worth three mana and a card, though I’m sure I’ll lose to this on some ridiculous 1/5 or something."},{"CardName":"Glaring Aegis","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Glaring Aegis is acceptable in super-aggressive decks, as it removes a blocker and makes your creature a lot harder to kill. It has the same glaring weakness as every aura, which is that removal and bounce owns it, so you may want to side this out if the opponent is flush with removal."},{"CardName":"Gods Willing","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Gods Willing is so cheap that you always end up ahead on mana and up a scry, which makes it a fantastic inclusion. As long as you don’t do something silly like run this in a deck with 10 creatures then you’ll be happy with it, and it really gains value if you are aggressive and have a lot of pump spells. It’s also worth noting that this can knock off auras like Pacifism, even when you draw it well after the fact."},{"CardName":"Griffin Protector","Rating":"2.5","Description":"It’s ironic that Griffin Protector is better on offense than defense, but I’ll overlook the blatant flavor fail. You don’t want too many of these, as they are a little clunky, but they will kill the opponent quickly in a creature-heavy deck."},{"CardName":"Griffin Sentinel","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’m a little higher on this than normal, as the heavy flying theme gives it some extra value. It’s a fine defender for three mana and pecks in for a damage reliably, which is well worth three mana."},{"CardName":"Hanged Executioner","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I like Hanged Executioner quite a bit. Getting two 1/1 fliers for three mana is good to begin with, and this can hang out until it’s time to sacrifice it and take out something big."},{"CardName":"Herald of the Sun","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Herald of the Sun isn’t cheap, but it does give you a 4/4 flier and a legitimate activated ability in the lategame. If you ever run out of things to do, pop some +1+1 counters on your other fliers and enjoy the fact that you have a 4/4 beater while doing so."},{"CardName":"Inspired Charge","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The go-wide theme in this set is well-supported, so you will want Inspired Charge more often than you’d think. If you reliably will be attacking with 3+ creatures, this is worth it."},{"CardName":"Inspiring Captain","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Inspiring Captain is a less all-in version of Inspiring Charge. It’s not as good as Charge when you are really going off but is much better when you have a worse draw. At worst, it’s still a 3/3 for four, which is definitely passable."},{"CardName":"Leyline of Sanctity","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Save this one for Modern."},{"CardName":"Loxodon Lifechanter","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I really like Loxodon Lifechanter. When you have any sort of built-up board, it gains you some life and threatens to attack as a 15/17 (or often more). The main issue with this is that when you’re far behind it’s just a dork, but there are plenty of situations where it does a ton for you."},{"CardName":"Loyal Pegasus","Rating":"3.0","Description":"How loyal can this possibly be if it refuses to attack or block without backup? I like this in aggressive decks, though it’s largely unplayable outside of them. You really need a ton of 2-drops to make this work, so don’t skimp on the bears."},{"CardName":"Master Splicer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m never turning down 5/5 worth of stats for four mana, and this even pairs nicely with Raise Dead effects and bounce spells. There are even a couple random Golems in the set, though you don’t need anything else to make this great."},{"CardName":"Moment of Heroism","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Moment of Heroism has always been a fine combat trick, and most aggressive decks will be happy playing one. It’s not great in control or midrange, though I do like siding it in against aggressive decks if you have a bunch of big creatures."},{"CardName":"Moorland Inquisitor","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This is basically the baseline 2/2 for 2, as it has a minor ability that doesn’t come up much, but it sure does fill out your curve. If you need to get on board then this does that, though it doesn’t do a whole lot more."},{"CardName":"Pacifism","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Pacifism is quality removal, even if Gods Willing and bounce spells can make it a bit of a liability. Two mana is just so efficient, and I’d play as many of these as I could get."},{"CardName":"Planar Cleansing","Rating":"1.5","Description":"At six mana, it’s hard to set up a good Planar Cleansing, which is why I’m not super high on it. I love 4-mana wraths, but six mana is just so much because you can’t just do nothing for six turns without dying. At best, you stall the board with a couple good defensive creatures and wait for them to overextend, but that usually only works once in a match."},{"CardName":"Raise the Alarm","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Raise the Alarm is better than usual because of all the token support, and I think multiple decks at the table will be interested in picking these up. It seems like there are more token payoffs than enablers, which makes this all the more valuable. It’s also fine without help, as 2/2 worth of stats at instant speed spread across two creatures is a solid deal."},{"CardName":"Rule of Law","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Once again, save the narrow anti-combo hate cards for Modern."},{"CardName":"Sephara, Sky's Blade","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I suspect the alternate cost on Sephara is better than it looks. There are a ton of fliers in this set, and all the flier payoffs make 1/1 fliers much more playable than normal. Plus, paying seven mana for this is worth it, as it’s a huge lifelinker that protects your other fliers. I like this as a control finisher or a part of an aggro flier strategy and wouldn’t mind taking it early."},{"CardName":"Soulmender","Rating":"1.0","Description":"There isn’t enough of a lifegain theme to make this a card you should play often, though every now and then I could see it making the cut. To be clear, it’s not good enough on its own merits, as a 1/1 that gains 1 a turn is too low-impact to be worth a card."},{"CardName":"Squad Captain","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Squad goals for this are to make it a 5/5, and ideally even bigger. If it’s not reliably hitting those marks, leave it on the sidelines, as paying five mana for a 4/4 or 3/3 just doesn’t cut it. Vigilance is especially good on a huge monster, and this is a real payoff for going wide."},{"CardName":"Starfield Mystic","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Starfield Mystic is mostly just a 2/2 for 2, as the enchantment theme isn’t strongly represented at lower rarities in this set. Let’s just say that at the mystic family reunion, this guy probably gets sick about hearing about his more successful cousin, Stoneforge."},{"CardName":"Steadfast Sentry","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’m not normally a huge fan of 3/2’s for 3, but Steadfast Sentry has two additional upsides that make it a solid playable. Vigilance means it can play both sides of the court and giving away a +1/+1 counter means that you don’t feel as bad when you trade it for a 2-drop."},{"CardName":"Yoked Ox","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Damn, that ox is YOKED. Despite an obviously successful workout routine, I’d leave the Ox in the sideboard, and only bring it in against a deck full of small ground dorks."},{"CardName":"Aether Gust","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"I recommend against maindecking the color-hosing spells, as they are just dead draws if the opponent isn’t either of the colors they target. That said, they are all very good sideboard cards, and I’d happily side in Aether Gust against anyone that is red or green. Note that the owner of the card (aka, the opponent) gets to choose where the card goes."},{"CardName":"Agent of Treachery","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Agent of Treachery may be a 7-drop, but it’s a permanent steal effect (it doesn’t end when/if this dies) and gets really busted with Raise Dead and bounce effects. I am a little disappointed this doesn’t untap lands like a real Agent of Treachery, though I know how absurd that would be."},{"CardName":"Air Elemental","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Air Elemental has carried its weight since Alpha and continues to be a premium uncommmon in every set where it appears. The stats and price are just right, and this is a great early pick and will be one of the better cards in your deck."},{"CardName":"Anticipate","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Anticipate is filler, and as such will only sometimes make the cut. It just doesn’t do anything, and even though it gives you decent card selection, it’s often hard to make room for a card that isn’t a creature or removal spell. I do like this more in decks lacking in 2-drops, as it fits better."},{"CardName":"Atemsis, All-Seeing","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Even though Atemsis has a somewhat awkward mana cost, it’s still a 4/5 flier with a powerful activated ability, and that rates highly in my book (a book that Atemsis has surely read)."},{"CardName":"Befuddle","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Like Anticipate, Befuddle is rarely bad but also easy to cut. It’s nice that this does provide the opportunity for a 2-for-1, even if it’s not super efficient."},{"CardName":"Bone to Ash","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Bone to Ash has a couple points in its favor in this set. It’s a great combo with cards that have flash like Brineborn Cutthroat, or activated abilities like Spectral Sailor. It’s also not bad with Unsummon, as you end up even on cards. Not every blue deck wants this, but if you have other ways to spend your mana at instant speed, it works out pretty nicely."},{"CardName":"Boreal Elemental","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Being an Elemental is definitely worth something in this format, and a hard-to-kill 3/4 flier is not a bad deal for five mana. When you find a boreal one like this, you should hold on to it."},{"CardName":"Brineborn Cutthroat","Rating":"3.0","Description":"You only need to get one counter onto Brineborn Cutthroat before it’s above the curve, and a 2/1 flash can give you plenty of options as-is. Unless your deck has literally no instants, this is a card that should always make the cut."},{"CardName":"Captivating Gyre","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m not super high on this mega bounce spell, as you need to be ahead on board for it to really be effective. I’m not a huge fan of cards that only work when ahead, and this fits right into that category. If you spend six mana and a card and don’t capitalize on it, your opponent is just going to replay two of the creatures you bounced, and all of a sudden you’re back to square one. As a curve-topper in an aggressive deck, Captivating Gyre is good, but in a random midrange or control deck I’ll pass."},{"CardName":"Cavalier of Gales","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Brainstorm in Limited most often reads “draw a card,” but that’s still a great ability when stapled a five-mana 5/5 flier. Cavalier of Gales is absurd, and even gives you a scry 2 and a shot at a redraw when it dies. That doesn’t put it too far from God-Eternal status, which is a good place to be."},{"CardName":"Cerulean Drake","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m really into Cerulean Drake, and I would always begin by maindecking it (the exception being a deck that has no interest in a 1/1 flier, like a very controlling build). If you play against a red deck this vastly overperforms, and the sacrifice ability works against any spell that targets you, not just red ones. I would side the Drake out against non-red decks, but the upside is worth starting it."},{"CardName":"Cloudkin Seer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Cloudkin Seer is the real deal. An aggressive flier for just three mana that also draws a card is fantastic in any deck, and it being an Elemental is the cherry on top of an already delicious treat."},{"CardName":"Convolute","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Three-mana counterspells are on the weaker side because you have to leave three mana up and there’s no guarantee your opponent will play anything relevant. Add to that the downside of this going dead in the lategame and you have a card I’m unhappy to have in my deck."},{"CardName":"Drawn from Dreams","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I dream of spending four mana to dig through my deck, even if it must be at sorcery speed. This combines nicely with cheap removal and defensive creatures, though any deck will be happy to have this."},{"CardName":"Dungeon Geists","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Dungeon Geists gets such a high grade based on efficiency and power. At only four mana, this can come out early and cheaply, and it always has a large effect on the game. The downside is that a removal spell does trade for it without lasting damage, but whenever this isn’t immediately killed, the swing is enormous."},{"CardName":"Faerie Miscreant","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"Unless you’re playing Pauper or manage to collect 5+ Faerie Miscreants, I’d avoid this trap. The first one not drawing a card is rough, and if you don’t get three in the same game you’re still not in fantastic shape."},{"CardName":"Flood of Tears","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Everything I said about Captivating Gyre applies here, though it’s even worse if you don’t get to play a free permanent. That’s not a card I’m thrilled to play, and it’s especially bad when you’re flooded."},{"CardName":"Fortress Crab","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Defenders gonna defend. Sometimes you just need a giant blocker, and Fortress Crab delivers."},{"CardName":"Frilled Sea Serpent","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Honestly, if you’re high and dry when it comes to finishers, you can play a Serpent and it’ll do its job, but I’d really hope to do better. This is just so slow and the ability is even slower, making it a card I only play reluctantly."},{"CardName":"Frost Lynx","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Frostie was good in every previous format, and even got a minor upgrade this time around because Elementals is a supported type. Paying three mana for a significant tempo gain is worth it, and this does a lot of work when ahead or behind (though isn’t great when at parity)."},{"CardName":"Hard Cover","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Hard cover, soft target. I’m not interested in spending a card for these minor upgrades, and the exposure to removal is a real downside."},{"CardName":"Leyline of Anticipation","Rating":"0.0","Description":"I don’t anticipate ever playing with or against this card. Even if it was always free, it’s not worth a card in Limited, and most of the time you’re going to be stuck paying full retail. Is there a bigger delta in the set for Constructed vs. Limited than the Leylines?"},{"CardName":"Masterful Replication","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Six mana for two 3/3’s is a mediocre deal, and you will never have enough artifacts for the second clause to do anything. I’m struggling to find anything masterful about this."},{"CardName":"Metropolis Sprite","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Metropolis Sprite gets a decent amount of damage in and can play nicely with any effects that pump its toughness. I’d mainly be looking to play this in a deck with 2-3 flier payoffs, or if I was drastically short on 2-drops."},{"CardName":"Moat Piranhas","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"In a deck that cares about attacking, this is basically a blank. In a dedicated control deck, Moat Piranhas lives up to its name (their name?) and stops non-flying creatures for long enough for you to get your control game in place. Not many decks will end up wanting this, but I look forward to playing the ones that do."},{"CardName":"Mu Yanling, Sky Dancer","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Mu Yanling will quickly fly away with any game where you can protect her, and with her +2 ability she even helps in that. Playing her, hitting +2, then -3, is a really tough line to beat and a very easy one to accomplish. Three mana is an aggressive cost, and I’m a big fan of Mu Yanling as a result."},{"CardName":"Negate","Rating":"1.0","Description":"As always, Negate is a card I basically never maindeck (Sealed aside) and am happy to side in."},{"CardName":"Octoprophet","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Octoprophet tickles my fancy and is a reasonable card to boot. It gives you some decent stats and a nice ETB ability, making it a fine play at any point in the game."},{"CardName":"Portal of Sanctuary","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Sadly, the designers stopped us from doing anything cool (and extremely annoying) by making this your turn only. That’s likely for the best, but it does leave Portal of Sanctuary in the “hypothetical but not actually good” build-around pile. If you have tons of ETB abilities, this may sometimes be worth trying, but I’m not holding my breath."},{"CardName":"Renowned Weaponsmith","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This rating is contingent on having 1-2 copies of the named cards, though Vial of Dragonfire is much better in general. Even if you do get all the pieces, the end result is far from busted, making this a fairly weak card overall."},{"CardName":"Sage's Row Denizen","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Sage’s Row Denizen provides a mediocre body and a mediocre win condition, which with their powers combined…makes a mediocre card."},{"CardName":"Scholar of the Ages","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Scholar of the Ages is a very powerful finisher. Playing this and picking up two removal spells is quite strong, and not that hard to pull off. Where it gets really spicy is when you bring back cards like Unsummon or Soul Salvage and start recycling the Scholar. Getting multiple triggers off this is disgusting and will lead to a (slow and grinding) victory."},{"CardName":"Sleep Paralysis","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Sleep Paralysis is a fine removal spell, and you will rarely cut it. It’s never exciting, but it sure gets the job done. Of note, I’m a little lower on Auras thanks to Gods Willing and Unsummon being in the set, though it’s still not a huge swing."},{"CardName":"Spectral Sailor","Rating":"3.0","Description":"As much as I rail against 1/1’s for 1, this letting you draw extra cards goes a long way in my book. Spectral Sailor is a real threat if the game ever slows down, and a 1/1 flier does have some effect on the board (even if it’s not much)."},{"CardName":"Tale's End","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This is a tale best told to a Constructed audience, though if the opponent has multiple legendary cards I don’t hate the idea of boarding this in. You will sometimes find other uses for the card, and it does answer some problematic threats."},{"CardName":"Unsummon","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The first Unsummon is worth a lot more than subsequent ones, as trading a card for temporary board advantage is not a deal you can make multiple times in most games. It does work out against auras, pump spells and can even save your own creatures from removal, so I do like having one in most blue decks."},{"CardName":"Warden of Evos Isle","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ideally you have at least a couple other fliers to go with this, and if you’re lucky, they are on the more expensive side. The floor is pretty high here, as a 3-mana 2/2 flier is solid, and if you ever curve this into a 5-drop you will be very happy with the results."},{"CardName":"Winged Words","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Divination is already a fine playable in most core sets, so getting that effect at 2 mana is something I’m thrilled to play. Even if this costs 3, you aren’t falling behind, so Winged Words ends up being pure upside."},{"CardName":"Yarok's Wavecrasher","Rating":"2.5","Description":"How good the Wavecrasher is does depend on your deck, as its ability can range from drawback to upside. If you’ve got a lot of cheap creatures and creatures with ETB effects, the Wavecrasher is great. If your deck is slow and has no good combos with this, it’s barely playable. Note that if it’s the only creature you have, the ability doesn’t do anything, and you can play this as a 4-mana 4/4."},{"CardName":"Zephyr Charge","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Zephyr Charge looks powerful but is too slow to really have a good effect. Your best bet is to side this in when it’s UG vs UG, though I’d usually err on just not playing it."},{"CardName":"Agonizing Syphon","Rating":"3.0","Description":"We may be a little spoiled by getting to play with Smiting Helix from Modern Horizons, but Agonizing Syphon is a solid piece of removal. Gaining three makes up for it being a little slow, and it will kill most things you care about killing."},{"CardName":"Audacious Thief","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I really like Audacious Thief. This card is going to steal games all over the place, because if it hits turn three and the opponent can’t stop it, the game ends very quickly. The most common way to enable this will be removal, though bounce works nicely too. The reason this is more highly rated than similar cards is that it triggers on attack, which means it 2-for-1’s the opponent when they block with a 2/2 and at worst you can throw it away to draw a card. That’s a lot of power, and Audacious Thief is one of the best commons as a result."},{"CardName":"Barony Vampire","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This is a pretty big letdown coming on the heels of Audacious Thief, and I’d only recommend playing it if you are short creatures or have Sorin (which is a mythic)."},{"CardName":"Bladebrand","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Despite being a good combat trick in Ravnica Allegiance, Bladebrand loses a lot of luster without Footlight Fiend to accompany it. Those sorts of synergies matter, and Bladebrand is not a card I expect to play all the time. If you have extra space in your deck and a bunch of small creatures, it’s fine, but by no means is it a premium card."},{"CardName":"Blightbeetle","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I don’t like Blightbeetle as much as some of the other protection creatures, because a 1/1 ground creature is quite a bit worse than a 1/1 flier or 2/1. That said, it’s not the worst maindeck inclusion, because protection from green is really effective at stopping big ground attackers, and you can side it out if your opponent isn’t playing green. This gets better if you have sacrifice cards, as at least you get to make the 1/1 into a relevant game piece."},{"CardName":"Blood Burglar","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The trend of creatures having keywords only on your turn is a cool one, and it plays out pretty well. Blood Burglar is only the second-best thief in the set, but it’s still a fine 2-drop and you’ll end up playing it most of the time."},{"CardName":"Blood for Bones","Rating":"2.5","Description":"You need quality creatures to make Blood for Bones good, and if you meet that bar it will deliver. It’s especially good when you’re sacrificing fodder, and ideally getting back creatures with good ETB effects. I really like the loop with Scholar of the Ages, but this is still great if you’re sacrificing a 2/2 to get back two larger things. Cards like this also make me think that Gorging Vulture will be a staple."},{"CardName":"Bloodsoaked Altar","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"The cost here is high enough that you can’t play Bloodsoaked Altar without doing some work. A six-mana 5/5 flier is great, but once you add in 2 life, a card, and a creature, the deal starts looking a lot less good. Some ways to get around that are Act of Treason, turning the sacrifice into upside, tokens, and fodder like Sanitarium Skeleton. Once you’ve mitigated the sacrifice part, the Altar begins to deliver, and this can be a powerful finisher in a sacrifice deck."},{"CardName":"Bloodthirsty Aerialist","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Bloodthirsty Aerialist isn’t so much a build-around as a decently-sized flier that sometimes really goes off. I’d play this without lifegain, and with 2-3 ways to trigger it, the Aerialist becomes quite the force to be reckoned with."},{"CardName":"Bone Splinters","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Unlike Spark Harvest, Bone Splinters doesn’t come with the option to pay the gold price. Iron it is, and you are always getting 2-for-1’ed unless you find a way to generate some sacrifice fodder. Luckily that’s not too difficult, and this will often find its way into your deck, though it doesn’t become great until you’re pairing it with Act of Treason."},{"CardName":"Boneclad Necromancer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"5/5 worth of stats for 5 mana is good, and by the time you cast this you likely will have something to devour. This helps token decks amass some forces and works well if you have ways to bounce it or bring it back."},{"CardName":"Cavalier of Night","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Cavalier enters with Bone Splinters and leaves with Unearth, both of which are solid spells. Add that to a 4/5 lifelinking body and you have a certified bomb on your hands."},{"CardName":"Disfigure","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Disfigure is incredibly efficient, and unlike Shock, can team up to take down bigger creatures without the loss of a card. Your 3/3 beats their 4/4 in a fight, and you only spent one mana in the whole exchange. Efficiency plus power is something I always look for, and this is one of the premium removal spells in the set (though note that it’s an uncommon now)."},{"CardName":"Dread Presence","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Dread Presence may not be the largest creature around, but it acts like a planeswalker if you’ve got enough Swamps. Pinging any target for 2 is huge, and when you’ve gained enough life and killed all their stuff, this starts drawing you cards as well. It’s got a heavy black commitment, but that doesn’t stop it from being one of the best cards in the set. I’d usually err on the side of playing this turn five so you can drop a Swamp and get at least one trigger guaranteed."},{"CardName":"Duress","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Duress is almost never maindeckable and is only sometimes a good sideboard option. Unlike Negate, this runs a good chance of whiffing and is a horrendous card to topdeck in the lategame. I’d only side this in if my opponent had a ton of spells, and in particular some expensive/powerful ones."},{"CardName":"Embodiment of Agonies","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Even though you probably can’t play Embodiment on turn three, it likely will be a 3/3 or larger in most games. That’s a fine deal for three mana, and deathtouch means that this still is relevant as a 1/1 or 2/2."},{"CardName":"Epicure of Blood","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The effect here is minor enough that I mostly see this a 4/4 body, which you can play if your deck needs it. With a couple recurring ways to gain life, the damage adds up, but it’s not a big enough payoff to make this a true build-around."},{"CardName":"Fathom Fleet Cutthroat","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The more aggressive your deck is, the better Fathom Fleet Cutthroat gets. It’s especially good in B/W tokens, as you will often be jamming a bunch of crappy small creatures into bigger ones, which sets up the Cutthroat perfectly. Be wary if your opponent ever swings a 1/1 into your 4/4, and try to avoid blocking if possible."},{"CardName":"Feral Abomination","Rating":"1.0","Description":"There’s no shame in running the Abomination, as it is a large threat, though there are enough dorky ways to end the game that it’s never going to be a high pick."},{"CardName":"Gorging Vulture","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Black has a bunch of cards which care about what’s in your graveyard, which make me think that the bird’s the word. Gorging Vulture is an efficient flier already, and milling yourself for four is definitely upside in this set."},{"CardName":"Gravedigger","Rating":"3.5","Description":"It’s hard to beat Gravedigger when it comes to value. This is a clean 2-for-1 and works very well if you have ways to bring the Gravedigger back after it dies. I’m always happy running this, and don’t mind taking it early."},{"CardName":"Gruesome Scourger","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Unless your deck is remarkably creature-light, Gruesome Scourge is a punishing threat and can easily end games. It’s capable of dealing a ton of direct damage and gets really sick if you have ways to recur it."},{"CardName":"Knight of the Ebon Legion","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I gotta hand it to Knight of the Ebon Legion. If you have three mana up, it’s a huge threat, and it even grows if it gets to whack the opponent. It doesn’t even stop you from pumping multiple times, so in the lategame this becomes even more of a monster."},{"CardName":"Legion's End","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Killing 2-drops isn’t always something you need to do, and I’m scared this will be a dead card in the mid to lategame. It’s fine to maindeck it as most decks will have 3-5 targets, but if they aren’t aggressive then I’m more than happy siding it out."},{"CardName":"Leyline of the Void","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Like most Leylines, this is great for Constructed and unplayable in Limited. The graveyard just isn’t worth spending a card on, even if they have multiple Raise Dead effects."},{"CardName":"Mind Rot","Rating":"1.5","Description":"It’s never a disaster if you end up maindecking Mind Rot, but it’s rarely all that exciting. I like it more in Sealed and prefer to sideboard this in against slow decks, as spending three mana to not affect the board can be a bad move."},{"CardName":"Murder","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Murder at common is shocking, but I’ll take it (especially if I see it in a pack). This kills anything, no questions asked, and does so for a very reasonable amount of mana."},{"CardName":"Noxious Grasp","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Noxious Grasp is another great sideboard card that I’d recommend against maindecking."},{"CardName":"Rotting Regisaur","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m all for Reggie here, as this ends the game so quickly that discarding a couple cards doesn’t matter. Note that if you have no cards in hand this doesn’t have a drawback, and that 7/6 is very big. It does hurt if this gets hit by Pacifism, and watch out for Unsummons in response to the trigger if you are empty-handed. I’d look to draft an aggressive deck to complement this, though it’s a good card in just about every archetype."},{"CardName":"Sanitarium Skeleton","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"I don’t like playing the Skeleton without combos, and even in a sacrifice/graveyard deck it’s slow and unexciting. It is cool that you can mill it with Gorging Vulture, but that’s not enough to make me crazy about playing it."},{"CardName":"Scheming Symmetry","Rating":"0.0","Description":"I’d be suspicious of Imperial Seal in Core Set draft, as skipping a draw step to find a card is often not going to be worth it (your best cards aren’t usually that much better than the rest). Once you make it so your opponent gets to do this for free and draws their card first, I’m completely off it."},{"CardName":"Sorcerer of the Fang","Rating":"1.5","Description":"A cheap early play that has lategame relevance is often a recipe for success, but this is anemic enough at both ends that I’m never going to be excited about it. It’s fine if you need filler, and not much better than that."},{"CardName":"Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord","Rating":"1.5 // 2.5","Description":"If you rack up a couple Vampires, Sorin gets a lot more attractive. On his own, he’s too vulnerable and provides no lasting effects, which isn’t a planeswalker I want to sink my teeth into. I’d like to have 2-3 Vampires alongside Sorin, and less than that dramatically reduces my interest in him."},{"CardName":"Soul Salvage","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Soul Salvage occupies a funny space. The first one is often great and can even be critical if you’re trying to play a grindy game, but the second one is way worse, and in neither case do you want to pick this super early. I’d err on the side of picking up one, and in decks with multiple Gorging Vultures, would gladly play more."},{"CardName":"Thought Distortion","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Not only does this cost a million mana, it even misses on the most common card type in Limited. Hard pass."},{"CardName":"Undead Servant","Rating":"1.0 // 2.5","Description":"You need three or more of these before I start getting interested, and even then I’m not that thrilled until you hit the 4-5 range. That won’t happen all that often, so only speculate on these if the packs have nothing else for you."},{"CardName":"Unholy Indenture","Rating":"0.5","Description":"The delayed gratification on this is too much of a cost, as there are plenty of ways for this to go wrong. You can put this on opposing creatures, but either way I’d recommend against playing it."},{"CardName":"Vampire of the Dire Moon","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This rating may seem high, but with three good ways to bring back dead creatures, a 1/1 deathtouch is at a premium in this set. Plus, adding lifelink is a real advantage, as it means that pecking away with your 1/1 actually gets you something now."},{"CardName":"Vengeful Warchief","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The Warchief isn’t exciting, but it can often grow to be a 5/5 or 6/6 without much difficulty. You can also grow this yourself, as you damaging yourself does indeed trigger it."},{"CardName":"Vilis, Broker of Blood","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"In a normal deck, eight mana is too much to realistically get to. It’s just too expensive, and Vilis is unplayable as a result. In a ramp-specific deck, things change a little, and this becomes a legit finisher if you have enough ways to control the game and gain resources. I will have fun trying to make this work and think it’s powerful enough to be worth doing so. If Vilis hits the board and you have a decent amount of life left, it will dominate with ease."},{"CardName":"Yarok's Fenlurker","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ravenous Rats gets a serious upgrade, and the Rats were good enough to begin with. This takes a card immediately and lurks around until you have enough mana, at which point it becomes an actual threat. That’s a great deal for two mana, and I’d always be happy running this."},{"CardName":"Act of Treason","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Act of Treason and other Threaten effects tend not to be good enough if you’re using them for purely aggressive purposes. Where they get interesting is in a R/B sacrifice deck, and there are some seeds for that here. Bloodsoaked Altar and Bone Splinters are the main outlets, and if I had two good ways to sacrifice, I’d be happy to play an Act of Treason."},{"CardName":"Cavalier of Flame","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Cavalier of Flame may be slightly behind the rest of the cycle, but it’s still a hugely impactful card. It lets you cycle any cards you don’t want, can pump your whole team (and sometimes even give itself haste), and occasionally will do a couple damage when it does. That’s more than enough to be a solid early pick, even if it’s not quite as hot as some of the others."},{"CardName":"Chandra, Acolyte of Flame","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"How good Chandra is hinges completely on how many spells you have to cast with her -2 ability. If you have 4+, Chandra will be good (though note that you do have to pay their costs still). If you have only a couple spells, she’s largely mediocre, as her other abilities don’t do a ton."},{"CardName":"Chandra, Awakened Inferno","Rating":"5.0","Description":"Big Chandra does just about everything you could ask for. She wipes the board of small-to-medium creatures, can pick off big ones in a more targeted fashion, and can use her +2 ability to put the opponent on a fast and inexorable clock. To top things off, she isn’t even counterable, making sideboard cards like Negate a joke. It’s hard to imagine the situation where Chandra isn’t awesome, and I’m happy giving her the highest possible grade."},{"CardName":"Chandra, Novice Pyromancer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Novice she may be, but Chandra gets the job done. Even as just a double ping, she would be fantastic, and she has multiple other useful modes too. Her mana ability gives you a way to play something huge or two spells in the same turn, and if you have an Elemental army she is happy to lead it. That’s a lot for four mana, and I’d be very happy to pick Chandra early."},{"CardName":"Chandra's Embercat","Rating":"1.5 // 2.5","Description":"The Cat ranges from a decent 2-drop to an awesome accelerant, all based on how often you get to tap it for mana. It’s also nice that in decks that care about it being an Elemental, which will have plenty of options to tap for."},{"CardName":"Chandra's Outrage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Chandra’s Outrage is classic good removal. It kills just about anything at instant speed, and even leave the opponent with some scorch marks on the way out."},{"CardName":"Chandra's Regulator","Rating":"0.5","Description":"Unless you somehow end up with multiple Chandras, I wouldn’t recommend playing this. It only lets you rummage away some specific card types and copying Chandra abilities is super narrow."},{"CardName":"Chandra's Spitfire","Rating":"3.0","Description":"While you do want a couple ways to trigger this, it’s hard to end up with actual zero, and the stats are good enough that I’d always be looking to start it. It’s a cheap flier that can block well, and every now and then you get to let it off the leash and attack for a lot of damage."},{"CardName":"Daggersail Aeronaut","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Flying on your turn is a neat way to give red some evasive attackers without messing up the color pie, and I think this is a cool design. It’s also a good aggressive card, and most red decks will be interested in the Aeronaut."},{"CardName":"Destructive Digger","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Destructive Digger is flexible and can definitely fill a hole in your deck if you need some lategame action. A 3/2 for three impacts the board well enough, and if the game ever stalls out you can start trading lands for cards. I like exactly one of these, and wouldn’t prioritize it too much."},{"CardName":"Dragon Mage","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Despite this being a huge Dragon, I’m not a big fan. It’s about one mana more than I’m comfortable paying, and having each player draw seven cards is likely a disadvantage if you’re able to hit them with a 5/5 flier. You don’t need that kind of variance when you’re winning, and you don’t need this card."},{"CardName":"Drakuseth, Maw of Flames","Rating":"3.5","Description":"At seven mana, you will need to do some work to cast Drakuseth. That means making a deck that can control the game, and ideally has some ramp elements to it. If you can cast and attack with Drakuseth you basically win on the spot, and that’s worth quite a bit to me. Breathing fire on three different targets is huge, and almost impossible to come back from."},{"CardName":"Ember Hauler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ember Hauler does his job and doesn’t complain, and is a fine card in any deck. A 2/2 early and a Shock as needed–it doesn’t get much better than that for two mana."},{"CardName":"Fire Elemental","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’d hope not to play Fire Elemental outside of Elemental-themed decks, but if you do have to, it’s still a decently-sized body."},{"CardName":"Flame Sweep","Rating":"3.0","Description":"It takes a little work to make Flame Sweep playable. In some decks, this will kill half your creatures, at which point it’s clearly not worth it. In others, it will devastate your opponent and leave your board untouched, so try and draft enough fliers or 3-toughness creatures so you can make the second scenario happen."},{"CardName":"Fry","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Fry is an excellent sideboard card and not something I’d recommend you maindeck."},{"CardName":"Glint-Horn Buccaneer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"As weird as this card is, it’s got a lot of stats and a couple neat abilities. I like it for the combination of good brawling ability and card selection, with the ping ability being a bonus more than anything else."},{"CardName":"Goblin Bird-Grabber","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This is a really funny card, and definitely grabs my attention. It gets a fair bit better if you’ve got some fliers, though you mostly want this in aggressive decks regardless (and they aren’t too picky about their 2-drops)."},{"CardName":"Goblin Ringleader","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"I’m looking for 5+ Goblins before I play this, which makes it a mediocre build-around at best. It’s just a lot of mana for a 2/2, and if you whiff on the ability, it’s a very bad deal."},{"CardName":"Goblin Smuggler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Goblin Smuggler is going to end a ton of games. You do want to be on the aggressive side before playing this, but once you are, it delivers. Haste adds a lot here, as it will often mean one less turn for the opponent to find an answer. This shines on stalled boards or as part of a curve, which is something I value in aggressive cards."},{"CardName":"Infuriate","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If you need a trick, I wouldn’t be angry about playing this one."},{"CardName":"Keldon Raider","Rating":"2.0","Description":"As long as you can swing the RR cost, Keldon Raider is a good addition to your deck. It’s large, it offers card filtering, and it isn’t too expensive."},{"CardName":"Lavakin Brawler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’ve been impressed with the Brawler. By herself, she attacks as a 3/4, and it’s very easy to make her into a 4/4 or 5/4. She also provides a lot of toughness and a good Elemental payoff, as well as being a sweet combo with Goblin Smuggler. You don’t need to do a lot of work to get value from the Brawler, which is my kind of build-around."},{"CardName":"Leyline of Combustion","Rating":"0.0","Description":"All the Leylines are just stone unplayable in Limited, though this one at least has vague sideboard possibilities against control decks."},{"CardName":"Maniacal Rage","Rating":"1.0","Description":"The removal in this set is not weak, which makes cards like Maniacal Rage way too risky of a gamble. If you really don’t have other options, you can try and cheese them out with this, but I’d recommend against it."},{"CardName":"Marauding Raptor","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Marauding Raptor is undeniably powerful but requires some deckbuilding costs. If you have only a couple creatures with 2 toughness, I like it (especially since that implies a lot of big creatures), but you can’t stick this into a random red deck and expect success."},{"CardName":"Mask of Immolation","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This coming with a 1/1 makes it a great value card, as it can ping anything and give you an engine for the entire rest of the game. I like this best in token decks, sacrifice decks, or aggressive decks, which is a wide range."},{"CardName":"Pack Mastiff","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If the format ends up being extremely fast, this could go up a notch, as it does a good Fathom Fleet Firebrand impression. I don’t care a ton about getting multiples, so you can pretty safely ignore that part."},{"CardName":"Rapacious Dragon","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like that the Dragon fixes your colors and helps set up some multi-spell turns, which is a good bonus on a 5-mana 3/3 flier. I can’t imagine not playing this and would take it early unless you’re already set on 5-drops."},{"CardName":"Reckless Air Strike","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Reckless Air Strike is a clear sideboard card, as trying to snipe artifacts and fliers in the maindeck is unnecessarily reckless."},{"CardName":"Reduce to Ashes","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’d basically always play this and am never thrilled about the prospect, which is a fine place to land. This kills most everything and even exiles it, making it one of red’s better answers to big creatures."},{"CardName":"Repeated Reverberation","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"This is a build-around for sure, and not an easy one. I’d want 4+ cheap removal spells in order to try it, and even then it seems a little dicey. It’s a tough ask, needing enough mana to play both cards in the same turn and having 3 targets, so don’t go out of your way to try and play this."},{"CardName":"Ripscale Predator","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Ripscale Predator is hard to block and has a lot of stats, though at six mana you really don’t need to prioritize it. Aggressive red decks often don’t want any six-drops, and controlling decks would rather have better defensive cards, so this mostly wants to live in ramp decks or midrange decks that skew aggressive."},{"CardName":"Scampering Scorcher","Rating":"3.5","Description":"The combo with Risen Reef is awesome, and even past that, I’m a fan of the Scorcher. It nicely supports Elemental decks and go-wide decks, and does so at a very reasonable cost. Plus, four mana for 3 1/1’s is just a good deal, so you don’t even need to be doing anything fancy."},{"CardName":"Scorch Spitter","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I wouldn’t play such a low-impact card unless you really need Elementals and are very aggressive, so plan on keeping this one on the bench."},{"CardName":"Shock","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Shock is reliably good, and that doesn’t seem likely to change in this set. It kills plenty of things and does so at the lowest cost you can find."},{"CardName":"Tectonic Rift","Rating":"1.0","Description":"It’s almost impossible to care about both abilities in the same game, and given the low power levels, I’ll be happy if I never end up with Tectonic Rift in my deck. I don’t hate it as an answer to Gift of Paradise, and it can be an aggressive finisher, but it’s just not great at anything."},{"CardName":"Thunderkin Awakener","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Even as a build-around, I’m not buying this in Limited. It’s too much work to temporarily get an Elemental back, and even with some 1-toughness Elementals you are still asking for too many things to go right at once. This even has to attack, which means it will die in combat almost every time."},{"CardName":"Uncaged Fury","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Uncaged Fury is a powerful combat trick, as it does a ton of damage on anything with 4+ power. That makes it worth running even in decks that don’t want tricks, as the damage potential is just so high."},{"CardName":"Unchained Berserker","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This attacks as a 3/1, making it playable regardless of what color the opponent is, and sometimes will just dominate against an opponent playing white. That’s a great deal, and one I’m glad to sign up for."},{"CardName":"Barkhide Troll","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This has both bark and bite going for it, as it starts as an aggressive 3/3 for two and can shrink itself to dodge removal. That’s a good deal, and the only note is that you ideally want 10 or so Forests in your deck so you can cast this on time."},{"CardName":"Brightwood Tracker","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I lean towards playing exactly one Brightwood Tracker, as it really gives you a good plan in the lategame. The 2/4 body helps block, and the activated ability looks at enough cards that you should be in good shape to track down some reinforcements."},{"CardName":"Cavalier of Thorns","Rating":"4.5","Description":"I’m trying to find a way to give all of these super high grades without being too cavalier about it, but really you can just read the card. Cavalier of Thorns is huge, has reach, and both triggers give you an advantage. The first one gets a land, which is solid, but also stocks your graveyard, and means that when this dies you get to put something good on top. That’s a lot of power for five mana, and I hope to open one of these every time I draft."},{"CardName":"Centaur Courser","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Even though this is just a vanilla creature, the stats to cost ratio is good enough that you aren’t realistically cutting it from any deck but the most focused (whether that be on control or a tribe like Elementals)."},{"CardName":"Elvish Reclaimer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like Elvish Reclaimer. It works nicely with Evolving Wilds and self-mill like Gorging Vulture, and by itself can eventually grow into a solid creature. It also does fix your mana and thin your deck, which is a pretty nice deal for just an initial one-mana investment."},{"CardName":"Feral Invocation","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Winning fights with Feral Invocation usually leads to winning games with Feral Invocation, as you not only killed their creature but have a monster left over. This doesn’t fit too well decks with too high a curve or that are short creatures, so avoid it in ramp/control decks."},{"CardName":"Ferocious Pup","Rating":"2.0","Description":"There are enough token and sacrifice synergies that I’d expect to play Pup more often than not, but you do need something to make this worth playing. On its own (well, you know what I mean), this is 2/3 worth of stats for three mana, which isn’t quite good enough."},{"CardName":"Gargos, Vicious Watcher","Rating":"5.0","Description":"Gargos is a house. Not only is this an enormous vigilance threat, but it only costs six mana, which means it’s eminently castable and will come down early enough to dominate the game. What really puts this over the top is the discount ability, as it’s insane when you get multiple Hydras.\r\n\r\nOkay, that’s a lie, the part that makes this insane is that it kills something if the opponent has a way to deal with Gargos, and Bolas help them if you have ways to target your own creatures. The fight part of this card is just obscene, and it makes this card one of the tippity-top in the entire set (especially when combined with the ridiculous cost and stats)."},{"CardName":"Gift of Paradise","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’m seeing a lot of good reasons to play Gift of Paradise, as it is a ramp spell that also fixes colors and throws in some life for good measure. Not every deck will want this, but if you are more than two colors or have expensive cards, this is quite the gift."},{"CardName":"Greenwood Sentinel","Rating":"1.0","Description":"It doesn’t get much dorkier than Greenwood Sentinel, as vigilance doesn’t do much on a 2/2 and green doesn’t seem to be interested in curve-out aggro."},{"CardName":"Growth Cycle","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Growth Cycle is a serviceable combat trick, though I’m not that excited about trying to draft a ton of these. There’s not a huge difference between +3/+3 and +5/+5 in most combats, so going deep on tricks is just asking to have a bad matchup against removal or aggro."},{"CardName":"Healer of the Glade","Rating":"0.5","Description":"This is nominally a sideboard card against aggro, but it would have to be super low-to-the-ground aggro before I wanted to board this in. It doesn’t actually stop a 2/2 into a 3/3, so don’t treat this as more than it is. I could also see this in a super dedicated Elemental deck, though that’s likely more of a Constructed idea than a Limited one."},{"CardName":"Howling Giant","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Besides being a great callback to the Black Keys, Howling Giant is exactly what I want to pay seven mana for. This has reach, so it defends against fliers, and makes two Wolves alongside it, so it trades favorably against removal. I’d gladly draft a ramp deck if I started with Howling Giant, and it works especially well if you have some ways to bring it back from the graveyard."},{"CardName":"Leafkin Druid","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The 2-drop accelerator is almost always a 3.0, and Leafkin Druid even has two little bonuses. First, it’s an Elemental, so it enables some of your other cards, and second, it can sometimes tap for two mana, which is often relevant even later in the game."},{"CardName":"Leyline of Abundance","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Like the other Leylines, this is way too situational to be of use."},{"CardName":"Loaming Shaman","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Most of the time, the trigger on Loaming Shaman will do nothing. It can marginally disrupt an opposing black deck that is trying to stock its graveyard, and in a long game can prevent you from being decked, but for the most part this is a 3/2 for three, which is playable but not fantastic."},{"CardName":"Mammoth Spider","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m a fan of Mammoth Spider. It shuts down just about every flier you’ll face, and helps the bigger green decks survive into the lategame. It can also rumble just fine if need be, as a 3/5 is substantial. I’m happy playing multiple Mammoth Spiders, and really prioritize the first one."},{"CardName":"Might of the Masses","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I don’t know where this scary green token deck is, as Might of the Masses keeps coming back at uncommon. You need a lot of creatures out for this to be great, and for the most part I haven’t seen it be all that."},{"CardName":"Natural End","Rating":"0.5","Description":"Sideboards here we come!"},{"CardName":"Netcaster Spider","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Netcaster Spider gives green another line of defense against fliers, which is kind of odd, now that I think about it. Still, this also defends you just fine, though I like it a little less than Mammoth Spider, since Netcaster trades instead of just stopping all the fliers."},{"CardName":"Nightpack Ambusher","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Nightpack Ambusher is a monster. Not only can it eat an attacking 3/3, but it gives you the option of making a Wolf each turn if you’re willing to forgo casting spells. This clearly combines well with other Wolves and instants, but even in a deck with zero synergy, this is incredibly powerful."},{"CardName":"Overcome","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The last time we saw Overcome, it didn’t quite deliver. Granted, Hour of Devastation was a strange draft format, but I still think the difference between this and perennial bomb Overrun is a big one. I like this most in creature-heavy decks that lean aggressive, as there are better finishers for control decks."},{"CardName":"Overgrowth Elemental","Rating":"2.0 // 3.5","Description":"In an Elemental-heavy deck, this grows out of control very quickly. It offers 4/3 worth of stats immediately (though the counter has to go elsewhere), and will gain life and counters as the game goes on. I’d even be happy playing this with just a couple other Elementals, as you only need either of the two triggers to go off to get a decent deal."},{"CardName":"Plummet","Rating":"0.5","Description":"As always, Plummet is solid sideboard material (and sometimes makes the cut maindeck in Sealed)."},{"CardName":"Pulse of Murasa","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Six life is a ton, and makes Pulse worth playing more often than you might expect. Whatever tempo you lose by spending three to draw a card is more than made up for by the life cushion, and this is a great way for your green decks to have a better lategame."},{"CardName":"Rabid Bite","Rating":"3.5","Description":"HAUMPH! Rabid Bite is consistently good, and because the other creature doesn’t fight back, there’s much less risk to this than with fight cards."},{"CardName":"Season of Growth","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"It’s hard to imagine what the reason for the season is, as this card asks you to have a lot of creatures and a lot of pump spells. I’m skeptical, but maybe in a deck with 5-7 pump spells (or Rabid Bites) this could be worth playing."},{"CardName":"Sedge Scorpion","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m happy enough using Sedge Scorpion to buy time for my bigger cards, and it even combos very nicely with Rabid Bite. Scorpions and Spiders team up to protect ramp decks, and 1-2 of these seems like a solid way to interact early."},{"CardName":"Shared Summons","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Shared Summons being an instant and getting two cards goes a long way for me, as this lets you pick up your two best creatures and proceed from there. I would be more likely to play this if I had some awesome things to get, and recommend against playing this if you’re looking to curve out and attack."},{"CardName":"Shifting Ceratops","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Shifting Ceratops is a house. It would be a fantastic card even without the pro-blue/counterspell stuff, and adding that means some decks will just have no good answers. All of the abilities this can gain are good in different situations, and the base rate on this is absurd to begin with."},{"CardName":"Silverback Shaman","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Silverback Shaman is awesome. It’s huge, can’t be chump blocked, and gives you a card when it dies, which will be often (unless the opponent just dies instead). It is a five-drop, so you don’t want to just slam infinite of these, but I like it both in aggressive or controlling green decks."},{"CardName":"Thicket Crasher","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I like the cards that are Elementals as a bonus, instead of something you pay for. Thicket Crasher is certainly one of them, as it gives you plenty of stats and a decent ability, with its type as a cherry on top."},{"CardName":"Thrashing Brontodon","Rating":"3.5","Description":"BrontyD is efficiently costed and has relevance the entire game, making it a good early pick. This dominates the board early and gives you protection against random artifacts or enchantments, which is an amazing deal for three mana."},{"CardName":"Veil of Summer","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"I really like Veil of Summer as a sideboard card. It can be an easy two for one if the opponent tries to kill or counter one of your things, and note that you can cycle it if they play any blue or black card, even something like a creature."},{"CardName":"Vivien, Arkbow Ranger","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Vivien has three fantastic abilities, and doesn’t cost much to cast (though triple-green adds a turn or two to her expected drop time). She puts a lot of power and toughness on to the board each turn, and you can put both counters on the same creature if need be. She also usually puts you up a card immediately, as you can play her and Rabid Bite something, so the floor is very high.\r\n\r\nHer -5 ability is interesting too. It’s the least powerful one, to be sure, but you can still get some value out of it if you run out of creatures to fight or put counters on (somehow). What I’d look to do here is keep an expensive dork in the sideboard, like an extra Vorstclaw or something, but I wouldn’t put anything good there at the expense of your maindeck."},{"CardName":"Voracious Hydra","Rating":"4.5","Description":"As someone who is usually hungry myself, I can relate with the Hydra here. It does give you options, as it can eat the opponent by being a huge monster, or eat one of their creatures while still being reasonably large. The doubling ability is so good that you can cast this for any X starting at 2 and feel paid off, which makes this super flexible when it comes to your curve.\r\n\r\nThis will often be able to eat reasonably-sized creatures at X = 3+, and that’s often a better option against a deck that has ways to deal with the Hydra. Regardless, you’re getting a great deal, and this is one of the best cards in the set as a result."},{"CardName":"Vorstclaw","Rating":"1.5","Description":"While this isn’t the vorst, it’s not the best either (apologies, but I was contractually obligated to make that joke). I’d rather have a 6/6 trample, if such a design exists, but I’ll still play this if my deck needs some extra beef."},{"CardName":"Wakeroot Elemental","Rating":"1.5 // 3.5","Description":"Wakeroot Elemental is almost a build-around, as it goes from mediocre to great depending on how likely you are to have five green mana available. If you can consistently make lands into 5/5’s, this is fantastic, and if not, I’d tend to avoid it."},{"CardName":"Wolfkin Bond","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I was unimpressed with Wolfkin Bond last time it showed up and I don’t expect that to change. It’s not a ton of stats, it gets blown out by instant-speed removal, and sometimes you draw your five-drop and don’t have anything to put it on."},{"CardName":"Wolfrider's Saddle","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Saddle up! This offers you a hard-to-block 3/3 and a persistent bit of value, which is something I’m happy to play. I especially like this with giant green monsters, making this the perfect way for ramp decks to defend themselves in the midgame and pressure the opponent lategame."},{"CardName":"Woodland Champion","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"Woodland Champion gets out of control very quickly in G/W Tokens with Raise the Alarm, and even has some green cards like Ferocious Pup or Wolfrider’s Saddle that can buff it. You only need one counter for this to be a good deal, so I’d play it even with as few as two ways to make tokens."},{"CardName":"Corpse Knight","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Corpse Knight is a solid beater that pressures the opponent even if it isn’t attacking, and gives tokens decks some extra reach. Imagine how busted this would be as a 2/3?"},{"CardName":"Creeping Trailblazer","Rating":"3.0 // 3.5","Description":"By itself, Creeping Trailblazer is a fine card. Its pump ability gives it a minimum of +1/+1, and it’s a 2-drop that can grow a little later. Where it gets really good is in the heavy Elemental deck, as it both pumps other Elementals and becomes a massive threat itself, making it a card I’m happy speculating on early."},{"CardName":"Empyrean Eagle","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Empyrean Eagle is the best reason to be U/W Fliers, as it’s an efficient beater that can provide a lot of stats if it sticks around. This is exactly what the fliers deck wants to be doing, and I’d take this as a sign that the deck is a good place to be."},{"CardName":"Ironroot Warlord","Rating":"3.5","Description":"You don’t need to be a token deck for the Warlord to be great, as it’s going to be plenty large even without trying. The activated ability is nice too, as it’s a fallback if you ever run out of things to do. I like Ironroot Warlord, and would be happy splashing it."},{"CardName":"Kaalia, Zenith Seeker","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"This applies to all of the 3-color legends:\r\n\r\nThe casting costs here are difficult enough that you can’t evaluate the cards as if they are a 3-mana 3/3 flier or a 3-mana 3/4. You are looking to play these around turn 5-6 (or later), so any that are efficiently costed (like Kaalia) lose a lot of their luster. They are also risky early picks, and only a few are worth jumping into without knowing where you are going to end up.\r\n\r\nOn to Kaalia. I don’t imagine you’ll have many of the types she seeks, which makes me pretty low on her. She’s hard to cast, really just a 3/3 flying vigilance creature, and not worth splashing unless your fixing is awesome."},{"CardName":"Kethis, the Hidden Hand","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Like Kaalia, I wouldn’t play Kethis unless you had perfect 3-color mana, which isn’t likely. His ability is essentially blank in Limited."},{"CardName":"Kykar, Wind's Fury","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Kykar, on the other hand, provides a lot of value if it lives, and note that it triggers off any noncreature spell, not just instants or sorceries. That makes this a powerful enough card to splash in blue-red or white-blue, and a solid build-around."},{"CardName":"Lightning Stormkin","Rating":"3.5","Description":"BZZZT. Stormkin comes down early and hits immediately, making it a great way to pressure the opponent and a card that will often deal 6-8 damage without trouble. Plus, it’s even an Elemental, which blue-red is a fan of."},{"CardName":"Moldervine Reclamation","Rating":"1.5 // 3.5","Description":"In a slow deck or one without creatures, I’d leave this to the mold. In a deck with lots of creatures and token-making, plus maybe a few sacrifice outlets, it becomes a dominating card. It gives you an entire gameplan by itself, and makes the opponent have to jump through hoops to make good attacks."},{"CardName":"Ogre Siegebreaker","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ogre Siegebreaker doesn’t feel like a gold signpost uncommon to me, but it is a card I’m fine playing if I’m red/black. The ability is expensive, and you usually traded a card already to get damage on their creatures, so it’s not like you’re going to run away with the game. The stats are fine, and ultimately what makes this playable."},{"CardName":"Omnath, Locus of the Roil","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Omnath is a fantastic splash card. It’s in a 3-color archetype that has a ton of support, and has two very powerful abilities. It will often eat something when it comes down, and getting counters plus making lands 8+ cycle is insane. Omanth is making waves in Constructed and is something I’d be very happy picking early in Limited."},{"CardName":"Risen Reef","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I love Risen Reef, as does everyone else. It’s just so fun, and extremely powerful to boot. I’d look to maximize my number of Elementals, especially with cards that make multiple tokens, but I’m also just playing this in any blue-green deck as a value creature."},{"CardName":"Skyknight Vanguard","Rating":"3.0","Description":"While Skyknight Vanguard may get through most of the time, the Soldier coming in attacking is mostly a disadvantage. Unless you have a lot of removal or tricks, the opponent will usually eat the Soldier for free, making this a powerful but inconsistent card."},{"CardName":"Tomebound Lich","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This may love books more than I do, and I love books. Tomebound Lich is a great play at any stage of the game, as it cycles through your cards (including one immediately) and can take down anything in combat."},{"CardName":"Yarok, the Desecrated","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Yarok is a decent splash, as a 3/5 with deathtouch and lifelink has a big impact on the board. If your mana is good enough (3+ free sources), I’d play Yarok without any ETB abilities, and once you have a couple good creatures with ETB abilities, Yarok’s value goes up meaningfully."},{"CardName":"Anvilwrought Raptor","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Much like 2019 Josh Utter-Leyton, Anvilwrought Raptor can win games but isn’t my first pick. It gets a little mileage from the flier build-arounds, but is expensive enough that I’d default to not playing it."},{"CardName":"Bag of Holding","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Bag of Holding is insanely good flavor, as it’s the perfect top-down from the Dungeons and Dragons item of the same name. This is a good way to grind out a long game, and sometimes even protects you against Mind Rot or Duress. Bag of Holding is cheap enough that I’d even play it in fast decks, as it’s a fine fallback plan for when you need to close out the game."},{"CardName":"Colossus Hammer","Rating":"0.5","Description":"Colossus Hammer is super expensive, and instead of granting evasion it actually removes it. That makes me wary about playing it, and would only play this if I had multiple Renowned Weaponsmiths to pay for the cost."},{"CardName":"Diamond Knight","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If your deck is about 2/3 of the same color, Diamond Knight is a fine option. It takes two spells to break even and three to get an advantage, making it a poor topdeck and overall a card I’m not looking to bet on."},{"CardName":"Diviner's Lockbox","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Paying five mana to draw three cards is passable, but not exciting, and this is so much worse than that. Keep the box closed, no matter what combos you may have with it."},{"CardName":"Golos, Tireless Pilgrim","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I like Golos as an early pick. It’s big and gives you an extra land, and that land doesn’t even have to be a basic. It also pushes you towards a 3-color deck, and once you’re there, I don’t mind playing an extra basic / dual in order to be able to produce all five colors. If you activate Golos, you will win the game in very short order."},{"CardName":"Grafdigger's Cage","Rating":"0.0","Description":"This stops maybe 2-3 cards in the entire set, if that. Do not play it."},{"CardName":"Heart-Piercer Bow","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I mostly like the Bow as a sideboard card against 1-toughness creatures, though it gains a little utility from Renowned Weaponsmith. Note that the templating is weird, and this is sadly not a combo with deathtouch creatures."},{"CardName":"Icon of Ancestry","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Once you have 6-7 creatures of the same time (likely Elementals), Icon becomes playable. The dig ability helps a lot, as it gives you something to do when you stall out, and of course combines nicely with the pump ability."},{"CardName":"Manifold Key","Rating":"0.5","Description":"The best use for this (besides untapping Time Vault) is as a sideboard card in a matchup where the board stalls out. That’s thin, and I wouldn’t look for this to be the key in most games."},{"CardName":"Marauder's Axe","Rating":"1.5","Description":"In a low-curve deck with token generation or fliers, Marauder’s Axe can do some real damage. I’d mostly stay away from it, but it can overperform if you have enough dorks that either have evasion or you don’t care if they die."},{"CardName":"Meteor Golem","Rating":"3.0","Description":"At seven, this is a little pricey, but it goes a long way towards stabilizing the board once it hits. It’s also colorless, and a fine early pick as a result. I especially like it in black decks with Soul Salvage effects."},{"CardName":"Mystic Forge","Rating":"0.0","Description":"There is no way you will assemble enough colorless cards to make this do anything, so I’d just forge(t) it."},{"CardName":"Pattern Matcher","Rating":"3.0","Description":"With even one set of doubles, I’d play Pattern Matcher, because the upside is real. Once you have 2-3 pairs to go get, this becomes very sweet, though I’m concerned about what it’s doing with that rabbit."},{"CardName":"Prismite","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This was mediocre in WAR and I expect it to be about the same here, despite the overall power level being a bit lower."},{"CardName":"Retributive Wand","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I mostly am looking to sideboard the Wand in against decks that are vulnerable to it, as it’s a little too slow of a card to play maindeck."},{"CardName":"Salvager of Ruin","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’ll leave the Teshar combos to Matt Nass, and try and avoid playing this in my Limited decks. At best, this trades 1-for-1, but it has to be in play the turn your good thing dies, which is a bit narrow."},{"CardName":"Scuttlemutt","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Changing colors is cute in a land of color hosers, and Scuttlemutt pays for itself by tapping for mana. If you’re two colors and don’t have any combos, its fine to leave this on the bench, but I’d be happy playing almost all the time."},{"CardName":"Steel Overseer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Even if this isn’t the menace that it is in Modern, Steel Overseer is a 2-drop that grows itself very rapidly. That’s worth playing, and I don’t mind taking this early."},{"CardName":"Stone Golem","Rating":"1.0","Description":"If you need a random beater, this mostly does the trick, though I’d be unhappy if I had to play this."},{"CardName":"Vial of Dragonfire","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Like Heart-Piercer Bow, this gets carried by the Weaponsmith more than on its own merits, and I mostly like it as a sideboard card against fliers."},{"CardName":"Cryptic Caves","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If your deck can afford a colorless land, I’d be happy to play Cryptic Caves. Cycling from play is good flexibility, and can help prevent flood."},{"CardName":"Evolving Wilds","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is about the same as the gain life lands, though it’s better earlier in the draft due to flexibility."},{"CardName":"Field of the Dead","Rating":"0.0","Description":"I don’t see how you are pulling this off in Limited, though it would be cute if you did."},{"CardName":"Lotus Field","Rating":"2.0","Description":"In a 3-color deck, this is still worth playing, though the risk of ruin is higher than I’d like (drawing this plus one normal land)."},{"CardName":"Bloodfell Caves","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier. I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Blossoming Sands","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier. I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Dismal Backwater","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier.

I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Rugged Highlands","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier. I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Scoured Barrens","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier. I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Swiftwater Cliffs","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier. I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Thornwood Falls","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier. I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Tranquil Cove","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of these lands are nice additions to any 2-color deck, and make splashing a third color much easier. I tend to take them a little higher than average playables, but under anything premium."},{"CardName":"Temple of Triumph","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Scry 1 is a real advantage, and I’d take these Temples aggressively. They are rare, so it doesn’t come up a ton, but treat them like real playables (and play them even when half on color)."},{"CardName":"Temple of Mystery","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Scry 1 is a real advantage, and I’d take these Temples aggressively. They are rare, so it doesn’t come up a ton, but treat them like real playables (and play them even when half on color)."},{"CardName":"Temple of Silence","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Scry 1 is a real advantage, and I’d take these Temples aggressively. They are rare, so it doesn’t come up a ton, but treat them like real playables (and play them even when half on color)."},{"CardName":"Temple of Epiphany","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Scry 1 is a real advantage, and I’d take these Temples aggressively. They are rare, so it doesn’t come up a ton, but treat them like real playables (and play them even when half on color)."},{"CardName":"Temple of Malady","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Scry 1 is a real advantage, and I’d take these Temples aggressively. They are rare, so it doesn’t come up a ton, but treat them like real playables (and play them even when half on color)."}],"TopCommonCardsByColor":{"W":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Griffin Protector"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Battalion Foot Soldier"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Raise the Alarm"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Dawning Angel"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Pacifism"}],"U":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Octoprophet"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Winged Words"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Boreal Elemental"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Frost Lynx"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Cloudkin Seer"}],"B":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Boneclad Necromancer"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Agonizing Syphon"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Gorging Vulture"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Audacious Thief"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Murder (by so much)"}],"R":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Reduce to Ashes"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Lavakin Brawler"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Goblin Smuggler"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Shock"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Chandra’s Outrage"}],"G":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Netcaster Spider"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Mammoth Spider"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Leafkin Druid"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Rabid Bite"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Silverback Shaman"}]}},"WAR":{"Ratings":[{"CardName":"Ajani's Pridemate","Rating":"2.0/3.0","Description":"At a base level, Ajani’s Pridemate is a passable card, and you may randomly end up with 1 or 2 life-gain cards in your deck. Once you have 3+, especially repeatable ones, this becomes a powerhouse, largely because the opportunity cost is so low on a 2-mana 2/2."},{"CardName":"Battlefield Promotion","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This isn’t much of a promotion—it comes with a small pay bump, but I bet the new boss is gonna pile on tons of new responsibilities. Basically, this is a fine trick if you’re in the market for one, but most decks will want 0-2 cards in this vein, and this doesn’t help your 2/2s take down 4/4s."},{"CardName":"Bond of Discipline","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m not very high on Bond of Discipline, despite it having a potentially powerful effect. This is the kind of card that really captures people’s imaginations—while there are games where this taps down six creatures and lets you attack for lethal (or near-lethal while you gain 10+ life), it also rots in your hand most games.\r\n\r\nWhen you have this in hand instead of another creature or a removal spell, you lose games where you just needed one more game piece, as this by itself doesn’t get you ahead. If you compare it to Sleep, it’s largely worse—it only gives you one attack step, and the life gain is similar to preventing a counterattack. Add that to the fact that Sleep varied by format (it was good in fast formats and mediocre in slow, removal-heavy ones), and you have a card I think will be overrated. It is worth mentioning that with more planeswalkers, this does give you a way to kill opposing ‘walkers, but most of them provide value immediately, so spending a card killing them is often not the most exciting proposition.\r\n\r\nOverall, this card is playable as a way to win races and break board stalls, but I’d only run it if I had a ton of creatures and little removal. I’d also side it out against decks with lots of removal, so please be disciplined and don’t just look at this and think it’s the next Overrun."},{"CardName":"Bulwark Giant","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This is expensive enough that I’d be looking to side it in against decks with reach (like burn, or funnily enough, cards like Bond of Discipline that get extra damage through). It’s a mediocre main-deck card, given the stats and cost, but if you’re playing a control deck and have no expensive cards, feel free to do your best Tormund Giantsbane impression. Yum."},{"CardName":"Charmed Stray","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Charming, yes. Effective, no. I’d mostly be looking to side this in against an aggro deck full of 2/1s, or maybe run this if I had multiple Ajani’s Pridemates and a life-gain theme. There will be around 3 of these per draft, and I would want 5+ before even considering them. A stray one of these won’t do much—you need the whole pack before they become a threat."},{"CardName":"Defiant Strike","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The floor on a 1-mana card that replaces itself isn’t very low, so I don’t mind Defiant Strike if you are a couple cards short. It’s also pretty nice in U/W or R/W, as there’s a spells-matter theme going on in blue and red, so sometimes you’ll end up enabling your Thunder Drakes or Spellgorger Weirds with this."},{"CardName":"Divine Arrow","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Divine Arrow is efficient enough that it’s beyond reproach, as it kills most things and does so pretty cleanly. It’s at its worst in aggressive decks, as they get to block before you can kill their creature, but even then it still removes 4/4s from play for only 2 mana."},{"CardName":"Enforcer Griffin","Rating":"2.0","Description":"At no point will you be excited to play Enforcer Griffin, but it should still make the cut more often than not. It’s a solid combination of stats and cost, and fills out the 5-drop slot with a beefy evasive threat. It’s nothing fancy, but it gets the job done."},{"CardName":"Finale of Glory","Rating":"4.5","Description":"At 4 mana, Finale of Glory is a slightly worse Call the Cavalry, but it scales up quickly after that. The sweet spot is 6-7 mana, though it’s absurd if you somehow get to 12. The reason cards like this are so good is that they are very strong with lots of mana, yet still castable and effective if you’re stuck on 4-5 mana. That flexibility plus power is worth a lot, and as a result this is one of the better cards in the set."},{"CardName":"Gideon Blackblade","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Gideon is powerful, but he can’t protect himself, which unfortunately may lead to him getting killed. When you are ahead, Gideon will stomp your opponent—an indestructible 4/4 attacker plus a good keyword each turn is a lot to handle. He eventually gets to exile anything he wants, though at that point your opponent is probably on the ropes anyway. That’s a lot for 3 mana, and Gideon is a legit early pick. Still, if you are behind, he doesn’t stop the opponent from bashing him, so he’s a step below the bombs in the set."},{"CardName":"Gideon's Sacrifice","Rating":"0.5","Description":"It’s really hard to get even one card’s worth of value from Gideon’s Sacrifice, much less multiple. If somehow you end up with a really big board, this could help sway a combat involving tons of creatures, but that’s just not all that likely, and on the face of things this is card disadvantage."},{"CardName":"Gideon's Triumph","Rating":"3.0","Description":"While I normally don’t like Edicts (cards that make your opponent choose and sacrifice a creature, named after Diabolic Edict, Killer of Morphlings, First of Its Name), Gideon’s Triumph works a bit differently. It only interacts with creatures that attacked or blocked, which means your opponent’s 5/5 can’t hide behind their 1/1, as the 1/1 won’t be getting into combat. Even if they do send both creatures, note that you can block and kill a smaller creature, then cast Gideon’s Triumph after damage to make the opponent sacrifice the bigger one. You will take damage, but that’s usually going to be worth it. I think this will play out pretty well, and I’d look at it like a slightly worse Divine Arrow."},{"CardName":"God-Eternal Oketra","Rating":"5.0","Description":"So this is effectively a 5-mana 6/6 (slightly better, as double strike stacks nicely with combat tricks and is harder to multiblock), and the drawbacks are that it’s unkillable and provides a constant stream of value? I’m in! God-Eternal Oketra is easily one of the best cards in the set, and you should slam it if you can—I’d even consider switching into white if I opened this in pack two."},{"CardName":"Grateful Apparition","Rating":"1.0/3.5","Description":"Without any other synergies, this is mediocre, but the synergies with proliferate are abundant and easy to find. If you have two other cards that work well, I’d be grateful for Grateful Apparition, and at 3+ it becomes one of the better cards in your deck. I’d mostly look for +1/+1 counters, though planeswalker loyalty is another good combo."},{"CardName":"Ignite the Beacon","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Paying 5 mana to draw two cards is a tough sell, and unless you have 3-4 planeswalkers in your deck, you may not have two cards to draw. It is true that Ignite the Beacon finds two of your better cards, so I’d consider it if I had one great planeswalker and a couple decent ones, but it’s slow enough that you have to make sure your deck has enough early game that you can afford to take a turn off to start igniting things."},{"CardName":"Ironclad Krovod","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Maybe I’m thinking too fondly of Wishcoin Crab, but I could see this providing ironclad defense of your planeswalkers. Granted, this format is shaping up to be slower than Guilds of Ravnica, but Crab was a 2.0 there, so I like starting this at 1.5."},{"CardName":"Law-Rune Enforcer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"We haven’t seen a tapper this good in Limited for quite some time (this set has a bunch of intentionally juiced commons, which should be interesting). I like that it can’t tap other copies of itself, as the “tap your tapper” dynamic can rune a game. This is cheap, locks down the creatures you care about (with the Zombie Army from amass being the most notable miss) and does a good job dealing with the progressively larger threats your opponent will produce. Law-Rune Enforcer is efficient enough that I’d play two with no problem, and three still sounds pretty good to me."},{"CardName":"Loxodon Sergeant","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Loxodon Sergeant may look appealing, but it’s mediocre. A 3/3 for 4 is passable, and adding vigilance to both it and your team for one turn doesn’t do a lot, so you end up with a filler card you’re not thrilled to end up playing."},{"CardName":"Makeshift Battalion","Rating":"2.0","Description":"In a creature-heavy aggro deck, Makeshift Battalion does its job. It’s a decent threat if you can trigger it once, and if you get there twice you got a very good deal."},{"CardName":"Martyr for the Cause","Rating":"2.0","Description":"A bear with upside is a fine playable, and Martyr for the Cause goes up in value if you end up with a bunch of planeswalkers and +1/+1 counters. It is pretty neat that it may stop your opponent from attacking entirely if you can chump and threaten a planeswalker ultimate, which really lets this live up to its name."},{"CardName":"Parhelion II","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Despite costing 8 mana and requiring multiple creatures to crew (or one big one), I’m still into it. It basically wins the game if it attacks, and this format does not seem like it punishes 8-drops as much as most. I wouldn’t slam it in an aggro deck, but as a finisher for control or midrange it doesn’t get much more powerful than Parhelion II."},{"CardName":"Pouncing Lynx","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I don’t like Pouncing Lynx much in defensive decks, but it’s a great attacker if you’re in the market. I’m not surprised we are starting to see more first-strike-on-your-turn cards—it’s a clean mechanic that plays well."},{"CardName":"Prison Realm","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Cheap removal that also scrys? Sign me up! There’s nothing fancy about this card, and it’s good in and against any Limited deck."},{"CardName":"Rally of Wings","Rating":"1.0/2.5","Description":"Not many decks will be able to play this, but it’s a beating when you do have a good Rally deck. A teamwide +2/+2 and an untap for just 2 mana is powerful—I’d look to have 8+ fliers in my deck before Rallying. Note that this works very nicely with Trusted Pegasus, and I’d count Pegasus as two fliers for this calculation."},{"CardName":"Ravnica at War","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If your deck mostly dodges Ravnica at War, I’d lean toward maindecking it, as it does hit hybrid cards, and there are a lot of multicolored cards overall. This is also a good sideboard card, though pay close attention to what your opponent has—you’ll want to side it out or in depending on how much it hits, and it’s critical you have the most accurate info possible."},{"CardName":"Rising Populace","Rating":"3.0","Description":"As long as you have a decent number of creatures/planeswalkers in your deck, this card will perform. Its stock rises especially quickly with planeswalkers, as those tend not to last too long on the battlefield."},{"CardName":"Single Combat","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m not a big fan of Single Combat. Your opponent getting to keep their best card means there’s no way to really punish them, and having both players wait a turn before reloading isn’t that huge either. I like this in Constructed, but in Limited I’m less optimistic."},{"CardName":"Sunblade Angel","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Sunblade Angel is expensive, so early in the Draft I wouldn’t prioritize her (you have so few spots for expensive cards that I like to start out with cheaper ones). Still, once she hits the battlefield she does work, and she scales very nicely with any sort of pump spells. All those keywords add up, and she can easily dominate a game, even if it is unfortunate that she dies to a bunch of common removal spells."},{"CardName":"Teyo, the Shieldmage","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Like any good shield, Teyo’s value is predicated on what he has to protect. If he’s guarding other powerful planeswalkers, he can be dynamite, but if you’re lacking in finishers he is more likely to break your heart than get anything meaningful done. I do like that he provides a lot of toughness and hexproof, so if you pick your spots right you can get plenty of value for 3 mana."},{"CardName":"Teyo's Lightshield","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I like this a bit more than I thought I would, all thanks to context (it’s what makes Limited great). A +1/+1 counter is just worth a lot more with proliferate in the set, and this gets you started when you have multiple ways to get value from counters. Teyo’s Lightshield also combines nicely with fliers, and at worst provides a 1/4 blocker to protect your planeswalkers. Note that this isn’t a defender, so if it gets enough counters it can start bashing."},{"CardName":"Tomik, Distinguished Advokist","Rating":"3.0","Description":"You can safely ignore all of Tomik’s fancy lands text, and evaluate Tomik as a 2/3 flier for 2. That is good, even with a WW casting cost."},{"CardName":"Topple the Statue","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Can anyone say best-of-one artifact hate? Topple the Statue does actually do the trick, as it’s Ice for 3 mana, and a cantrip Shatter if they happen to have an artifact. Killing Parhelion with this is gross, and even if they don’t have any good targets you can still tap down a key blocker or even a land on their upkeep."},{"CardName":"Trusted Pegasus","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Having this at 2/2 instead of 1/3, like the last couple incarnations of the effect, is a big change. This slants much more aggressive than Pegasus Courser, and can really pressure both opponents and their planeswalkers. Trusted Pegasus is fantastic in aggressive decks and really solid everywhere else, with only the most glacial of control decks not being interested."},{"CardName":"The Wanderer","Rating":"2.5","Description":"This wanders back and forth between being nearly a dead card and almost unbeatable, all depending on your opponent’s deck. If they have a lot of big creatures, it can eviscerate their board, and lead to an insane 2-for-1. If not, it’s basically blank, which makes me want to sideboard it unless I’m very short on removal. It’s also relevant that it protects your creatures from burn spells, even if you won’t always know when that part is being good."},{"CardName":"Wanderer's Strike","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Wanderer’s Strike is a solid piece of removal, and in some sets would be among the better options. This set has a bunch of pushed commons, which makes Strike more of a decent card than a truly desirable one. I also wouldn’t worry too much about the proliferate part—in some decks that will be a good bonus, but even if you have zero combos, it’s a fine card."},{"CardName":"War Screecher","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I like cheap creatures with expensive activated abilities, as they tend to be good at any point in the game. War Screecher is no exception, as it’s a relevant early drop and a great way to use your mana later in the game. It does get better in aggressive decks, but it’s still fine in any deck that needs a 2-drop."},{"CardName":"Ashiok's Skulker","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The idea here is that this can skulk by the opponent’s defenses and kill planeswalkers, but in practice it’s just a little too expensive to be good. I’d play this if I needed a body, as a 3/5 for 5 is passable, but it’s not a high priority card."},{"CardName":"Augur of Bolas","Rating":"1.5/2.5","Description":"In the spells-matter deck (mostly U/R) this is a fine 2-drop. At 8 spells, you’re 50/50 to find one, which is decent. When you start lowering the spell count, this gets worse and worse, and it’s not worth playing in the average 5-6 spell deck."},{"CardName":"Aven Eternal","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I really like Aven Eternal. A 2/2 flying plus a 1/1 is a great deal by itself, and this can combine with other amass cards and sacrifice outlets for additional value. You can’t go wrong with a powerful card that’s good on its own and good when combined with major themes of the set."},{"CardName":"Bond of Insight","Rating":"1.0/3.0","Description":"I’ve been liking Bond in spell-heavy Draft decks. It flips four cards, so you have a few additional shots at finding better options, and a 2-for-1 that gets all the good common removal spells back is something I’m in for. This is another spells-matter payoff, and again rewards synergy more than just being a powerful card in a vacuum."},{"CardName":"Callous Dismissal","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This sounds better when you think about it as a 1/1 Man-o’-War (it sure did when I framed it that way for Marshall on the LR set review), and it plays nicely with the various amass payoffs. I also like that it’s a 2-drop if you need to make a relevant play early, and a good way to push damage through late. This is flexible and gives you good value, though the number is small enough that sometimes you want to trade your amass token off before casting this, as a 1/1 is often better than a +1/+1 counter (and that’s true for any amass card—think of ways to use the creature in order to get a new one)."},{"CardName":"Commence the Endgame","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Fittingly, this sounds like an Archenemy scheme rather than a normal Magic card. I’m a huge fan of Commence the Endgame—a 4/4 or 5/5 at instant speed that also draws you two cards is a beating. This can frequently ambush an attacker, and can be used as a combat trick if you already have an Army in play."},{"CardName":"Contentious Plan","Rating":"3.0","Description":"There’s nothing contentious about this card—it’s just great. It’s a low-cost way to get extra mileage out of amass cards and +1/+1 counters, and puts extra loyalty onto planeswalkers. Replacing itself is huge, and Contentious Plan is one of the best ways to make your proliferate deck tick."},{"CardName":"Crush Dissent","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Crush Dissent is way worse than it looks. Leaving mana up for this and having the opponent play around it is brutal, and given that it isn’t a hard counter, it’s often easy for them to avoid walking into it. It’s also quite difficult to get to a board state early where you can leave up 4 mana, and later in the game it won’t usually counter anything. Crush Dissent is not a card I’d be happy to play, and the more people get used to factoring it in, the worse it will get."},{"CardName":"Erratic Visionary","Rating":"2.5","Description":"As much as I like looters (I always loot), paying 2 mana is a real cost. I still do like that this is a 2-drop that develops your board while being a decent way to filter cards later, and 1/3 is a good statline to dump +1/+1 counters on in a proliferate deck."},{"CardName":"Eternal Skylord","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I’ve had the pleasure of playing with this multiple times by now, and my estimation of it keeps going up. Eternal Skylord dominates the board, at worst is a 3/3 plus a 2/2, and frequently lets you hit with a 5/5 flyer the turn you play it. This is one of the best amass payoffs in the set, and even works nicely with proliferate, making it a slam-dunk early pick."},{"CardName":"Fblthp, the Lost","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Fblthp isn’t just a meme card, as a 2-mana 1/1 that draws a card is a solid playable. It won’t get shuffled back or played from your deck very frequently, but I’ll take an Elvish Visionary any day of the week."},{"CardName":"Finale of Revelation","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This format lends itself well to this card, and if you can fire this off for 5 or 6 mana, you should be able to close out the game shortly thereafter. This pairs well with green acceleration or cheap removal in red-black, so keep that in mind if you pick this up early."},{"CardName":"Flux Channeler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Flux Channeler looks like a build-around but it actually fits into just about any blue deck. It does get better when you try and maximize the ability, but your average deck will have 5+ spells and a bunch of rewards for proliferating, making this a great card even without putting in much work. Proliferate is a real thing, and this makes all of your amass cards and planeswalkers that much better."},{"CardName":"God-Eternal Kefnet","Rating":"5.0","Description":"All the God-Eternals are just absurd, and Kefnet is no exception. A 4-mana 4/5 flyer is already great, and this gives you random card advantage and is nearly unkillable. If you’re lucky enough to get graced by a God-Eternal, do not turn down that gift."},{"CardName":"Jace, Wielder of Mysteries","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I would like Jace a lot more if his cost was a little bit lighter on the blue requirements. A lot of the power of planeswalkers is dropping them at the right time, ideally when ahead on board. At triple-blue, Jace is awkward to cast, though quite good when you get him into play. A card a turn and high loyalty is a good combo, and Jace can mill either player out to good effect. In general, I’d target the opponent, unless you’re very confident you can keep Jace alive."},{"CardName":"Jace's Triumph","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’ve never turned down a Divination, and I certainly won’t be starting now. Don’t be fooled though—this being uncommon is because it’s part of a cycle, not because Divination is all of a sudden better than common power level."},{"CardName":"Kasmina, Enigmatic Mentor","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Move over Jace, a new Wizard has entered the arena! Kasmina combines a powerful passive and a great minus ability, making her a great early pick. A 2/2 + a loot is great, and making the opponent pay more to target your stuff with spells increases the odds she survives to -2 a second time. Throw a little proliferate into the mix and you have a card that can snowball early and is wonderful late."},{"CardName":"Kasmina's Transmutation","Rating":"1.0","Description":"While this is a solution to some problematic cards (like God-Eternals), overall it’s a fairly bad one. Your opponent gets to keep a 1/1, and can rescue their creature later with bounce or enchantment removal. This also doesn’t interact well with armies, as they are 0/0 base, so this actually makes them bigger."},{"CardName":"Kiora's Dambreaker","Rating":"2.0","Description":"While I wouldn’t call this great, it’s been pretty dam good, and definitely better than it looks. Proliferate is a well-supported mechanic, and it’s easy to get two counters or more out of this, which makes it worth 6 mana."},{"CardName":"Lazotep Plating","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’m a fan of Lazotep Plating. It will often save a creature and give you a solid bonus, and it can even protect you from discard or burn that’s going upstairs. That’s a lot of value for 2 mana, though if you have zero other amass cards you may end up cutting this."},{"CardName":"Naga Eternal","Rating":"0.5","Description":"There are more than enough playables in this format, and I’d be eternally sad if this made the cut."},{"CardName":"Narset, Parter of Veils","Rating":"1.0/3.0","Description":"Narset is very similar to Augur of Bolas and operates under basically the same restrictions. I have had the passive come up before, and it was pretty annoying against my looter, but for the most part it won’t make a huge impact."},{"CardName":"Narset's Reversal","Rating":"0.5","Description":"Narset’s Reversal is too narrow for what you end up getting. Even when this does work, it’s not often a huge blowout, and it will rot in your hand too often for my taste."},{"CardName":"No Escape","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I don’t mind playing one of these if I need another 3-drop, as this does counter most of the cards you care about. Having only a single blue in the cost and providing a scry 1 makes this easy to use and rewarding, though you don’t want too many counters in most decks."},{"CardName":"Relentless Advance","Rating":"1.5","Description":"While Relentless Advance is better than a Hill Giant, you do need a couple of synergies before it becomes good enough to play. I’d run this with 2+ amass or proliferate payoffs, and it even checks the box for spells-matter decks if you run short. These aren’t hard to pick up, so don’t go nuts grabbing them early."},{"CardName":"Rescuer Sphinx","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The Sphinx is a big flyer that often bounces something with a good ETB ability, which is well worth 4 mana. I’ve liked this with Lazotep Reaver primarily, though there are plenty of juicy options to pick up. It’s also perfectly playable without synergies, as it threatens enough damage in the air that it’s a force to be reckoned with."},{"CardName":"Silent Submersible","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m deeply disappointed in Silent Submersible. Not only is it mediocre in Limited, which is a waste of a cool card concept, how does the submarine not have evasion of some kind?! The flavor judge in me finds this wanting."},{"CardName":"Sky Theater Strix","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Much like the actual theater experience these days, this usually isn’t worth leaving home for. It takes too much work to get a good damage output, and doesn’t block well at all. I could see running it in very dedicated spells decks, or siding it in against specific planeswalkers if your opponent is weak to flyers."},{"CardName":"Spark Double","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Finally, MTG Arena’s own Sparky gets a card! Spark Double is almost always worth more than the mana you paid for it, as a +1/+1 counter or +1 loyalty makes copying a 3-drop pretty good value (and that’s near the floor). This card is splashable, powerful, and only requires that you have some good creatures/planeswalkers in order to profit."},{"CardName":"Spellkeeper Weird","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Even in spells-matter decks, this is a little bit slow. It does do a decent job of defending you early, but getting the spell back is more of a late-game bonus than the main focus of the card. I’d look to play this when I have 5+ good spells to get back, ideally alongside a few others just to have options."},{"CardName":"Stealth Mission","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Even though this does let you kill most planeswalkers with ease, it usually isn’t that great of a deal. Spending a card to kill a planeswalker that already used its ability isn’t where I want to be, even if I get a couple +1/+1 counters as part of the deal. In an aggressive deck, this is a decent finisher, but most blue decks don’t seem to be interested in closing out the game like this."},{"CardName":"Tamiyo's Epiphany","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I foresee casting this card a lot, especially given how nicely it pairs with removal. Getting to look at up to six cards is immensely powerful, and it gives you a great chance of finding whatever you are looking for. The only reason this isn’t the best blue common is because of how absurd Aven Eternal is, but both are well above the curve we are used to for commons."},{"CardName":"Teferi's Time Twist","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Running the triple T is perfectly reasonable, and gets better the more ETB and proliferate effects you have. This is the kind of card it can be hard to find room for, so don’t prioritize it, but if you have an extra slot this fights removal pretty well."},{"CardName":"Thunder Drake","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I really like Thunder Drake. It’s not hard to make this a 3/4, and 4/5 is definitely not out of the question. It makes cheap cards more valuable, especially cantrips like Defiant Strike, and fits perfectly into the blue-red spells deck."},{"CardName":"Totally Lost","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Fblthp’s Signature Spellbook is a passable card, but not exciting in the slightest. You play this if you have no other good removal options, or if your spells-matter deck really needs another instant. Note that against planeswalkers, you often want to cast this during the opponent’s draw step. That stops them from using the planeswalker that turn, because they can’t until their main phase, but also prevents them from drawing it since they’ve drawn for their turn, so you get a guaranteed turn off."},{"CardName":"Wall of Runes","Rating":"1.5","Description":"In a good control deck, Wall of Runes can buy you some breathing room at a pretty cheap cost. Blocking early and scrying gives you time to leverage cards like Tamiyo’s Epiphany, which makes this a little better than it looks."},{"CardName":"Aid the Fallen","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If you have 2 good planeswalkers, this becomes a decent addition to your deck, and at 3+, it’s actively good. There’s also a big difference between good uncommon planeswalkers and busted rare ones, so the high end here is pretty high. That all said, I usually want 0 main deck and 1 sideboard, so I wouldn’t take this too early."},{"CardName":"Banehound","Rating":"0.5","Description":"This doesn’t have a big enough impact on the game to be good—haste on a 1/1 is underwhelming and as much as I like lifelink, you need a lot of pump spells before this actually does anything."},{"CardName":"Bleeding Edge","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Ravenous Chupacabra this is not, but it is still a great removal spell. It picks off a small creature and provides good value while doing so. This card is great in any deck, though it does get better in one focused on amass."},{"CardName":"Bolas's Citadel","Rating":"1.0/3.5","Description":"The split rating on this is a little weird, but Bolas’s Citadel is a weird card. In a normal deck, you shouldn’t play this, as it costs a ton of mana and requires you have a lot of life to take advantage of it. In a deck with good ramp, defense, and life gain, it can be quite the engine, and it is obscenely powerful if you have enough life points. This one is going to need more testing, but I am going to start with it in the “powerful build-around” camp, where it delivers if you do the work."},{"CardName":"Bond of Revival","Rating":"1.0","Description":"There isn’t really a reanimator strategy present here, so this would have to see play on base power level alone. Unfortunately for Zombify fans, that power level isn’t very high, as this only selects from your graveyard, and giving haste doesn’t do enough to get it over the line and into your deck."},{"CardName":"Charity Extractor","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The flavor on this card is great, and it’s a solid defender to boot. It is one of the best cards to pair with Huatli, and you can extract max value off even one hit with those two cards in play. I’d look to play this in defensive decks, or to side it in against opponents attacking on the ground."},{"CardName":"Command the Dreadhorde","Rating":"1.0/3.5","Description":"This is eerily similar to Bolas’s Citadel. It costs the same and rewards largely the same deckbuilding, and like the Citadel, is very powerful when you can get it to work. In a control deck with a lot of life gain, it’s a powerful finisher, especially if you have removal to put some of their better targets into the graveyard."},{"CardName":"Davriel, Rogue Shadowmage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"A 3-mana Fugue is a beating, and if the opponent is unable to kill Davriel, Rogue Shadowmage, that’s exactly what you get. You can also keep this around and ping the opponent for 2 a turn, which is a nice option to have. Davriel is high upside and low downside, and one of the more punishing planeswalkers when unanswered."},{"CardName":"Davriel's Shadowfugue","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Despite this format not being super fast, it’s also a format where it’s easy to get behind on board. Planeswalkers are a big part of that, as are powerful cards like the various 2-for-1 amass creatures or proliferate combos. As such, paying 4 mana to knock two cards out of the opponent’s hand isn’t something I’m interested in doing, and this is more of a sideboard card for control mirrors."},{"CardName":"Deliver Unto Evil","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I really like this art style, though the card itself isn’t quite as good. It’s powerful in a control deck that fills up its graveyard, but for the most part is worse than other methods of gaining card advantage."},{"CardName":"Dreadhorde Invasion","Rating":"4.0","Description":"On turn 2, this is nigh-impossible to beat. Later in the game, it has a much less immediate effect and sometimes just won’t do enough. That still makes it a great card, and one I’m happy to take early. The lifelink part is huge too—it’s worth taking strides to make sure you get at least one big lifelink hit in."},{"CardName":"Dreadmalkin","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’ve liked Dreadmalkin quite a bit. It’s hard to block, both due to menace and because of the instant-speed ability to grow. It hunts down planeswalkers and gives you the perfect way to use amass tokens. With this out, you usually want to eat 1/1 amass tokens before playing more amass cards, as that gives you more value than making the token bigger."},{"CardName":"Duskmantle Operative","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This isn’t a format for 2-mana 2/2s, especially ones with such a mediocre ability. Stay clear of this unless you’re aggressive and really lacking at this spot in the curve."},{"CardName":"The Elderspell","Rating":"2.0/3.0","Description":"The first rating is for the main deck, where I’d play The Elderspell if I was short on removal for planeswalkers (especially if I have a couple to add loyalty to). The second is for sideboard use, where it’s a good efficient answer if your opponent has a few in their deck. Note that while I’m not high on cards like Stealth Mission as an answer to planeswalkers, having a 2-mana direct kill spell is different. This is less vulnerable to removal and can help get you back into the game when you’re behind."},{"CardName":"Eternal Taskmaster","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like the Taskmaster, as it’s got good stats and a reasonable ability, but I will say that it’s a little less good than it looks. This is good, not great, and I’ve found myself taking Lazotep Reaver over it in decks full of sacrifice/amass synergies. It just doesn’t come up that this has a clear attack and something good to get back, alongside the time and mana needed to use it."},{"CardName":"Finale of Eternity","Rating":"5.0","Description":"This is Plague Wind for 5-7 mana, and that’s just off-the-wall absurd. Finale of Eternity is easily one of the best cards in the set."},{"CardName":"God-Eternal Bontu","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Bontu is enormous, unkillable, and lets you cash in lands plus bad creatures for extra cards. That’s more than enough for me, and I’d be eternally grateful to get to take this first pick."},{"CardName":"Herald of the Dreadhorde","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Cards like this are why I dread attacking on the ground against black decks. It’s hard to avoid getting 2-for-1’d against this, and it’s a very good way to clog up the board. Herald works perfectly well on its own, and does even better with sacrifice or amass synergy, making it a solid common indeed."},{"CardName":"Kaya's Ghostform","Rating":"0.5","Description":"Kaya’s Ghostform is too situational for me to want to play it, and gets trounced by bounce spells and tap effects. Having an effect like this that requires you to predict which of your creature or planeswalkers will get killed beforehand is too risky, and not worth the payoff when you do get it right."},{"CardName":"Lazotep Behemoth","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Sometimes, you just need a big purple Hippo."},{"CardName":"Lazotep Reaver","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This doesn’t quite get to 3.5, but it’s close. There are precious few good 2-drops in the format, and this one checks a lot of boxes. It works in a wide variety of decks, has tons of synergies, and even by itself is pretty good value. I don’t fear the Reaver and in fact, I’m a very big fan."},{"CardName":"Liliana, Dreadhorde General","Rating":"5.0","Description":"Liliana is absurd when ahead, when behind, and at parity. She has tons of loyalty, so just using her +1 already makes her hard for flyers to kill, and forget about attacking on the ground. Her passive is unbeatable once your opponent starts trading in combat, and great even if you’re just chump-blocking. She can also clear the board quickly if the opponent is only on a few creatures, and her ultimate (if it gets that far) is game over too. She competes with Ugin for title of best card in the set, and in this set, that’s saying a lot."},{"CardName":"Liliana's Triumph","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Edicts are at a low point in this set, what with amass and various death triggers floating around. I prefer sideboarding Triumph against decks lacking in creatures, and would recommend against putting this in your main deck."},{"CardName":"Massacre Girl","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Massacre Girl lives up to her name (and it’s a sweet name, at that). She goes up the chain nicely, killing a 1/1, which then kills a 2/2, and so on. Note that the effect lasts until end of turn, so playing her and then using a removal spell can kick start a domino effect. She’s also great post-combat after their creatures block your smaller ones, and overall this is just a very good card."},{"CardName":"Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted","Rating":"3.0/3.5","Description":"Ob is a great card, but can be a little tricky to use. When you’re ahead, he’s amazing, as the opponent will often not have time to use all the cards anyways. That makes him something akin to double Unlicensed Disintegration, which is usually unbeatable. In an attrition-based game, giving your opponent two cards per creature isn’t as appealing, but you can actually start pointing him at your own creatures instead. Killing a 1/1 amass token or a Lazotep Reaver in exchange for two cards is a great deal, and Ob’s passive still pressures the opponent at 1 per turn. On balance, Ob is much better in aggro decks, but with the right setup he’s good anywhere."},{"CardName":"Ob Nixilis's Cruelty","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m loving the pushed commons in this set, and Cruelty is the prime example. This kills just about anything at instant speed, and even gets around death triggers to boot."},{"CardName":"Price of Betrayal","Rating":"0.5","Description":"I like this as a sideboard card against planeswalkers more than a main deck option. This is less powerful and has less upside than The Elderspell, which is why they differ in ratings. I really don’t want to be taking counters off creatures either, even if this does kill amass tokens when needed."},{"CardName":"Shriekdiver","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The rating on this takes a bit of a dive in non-aggro decks, and I’ve mostly liked using Shriekdiver to attack planeswalkers. It’s a fine card if you need a 3-drop, but the stats are small enough that I am not excited about it."},{"CardName":"Sorin's Thirst","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Sorin’s Thirst is a decent way to interact, but the BB casting cost really hurts it. I like it when I have 9-10 Swamps in my deck, and am not a huge fan when black is the secondary color. The effectiveness of this just falls off later in the game, and when you can’t cast it early it ends up underperforming."},{"CardName":"Spark Harvest","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Spark Harvest is definitely behind Ob Nixilis’s Cruelty, but not by a whole lot. This kills both creatures and planeswalkers, and can do so cheaply in a pinch. Either mode of this is worth including, and having the option of both really pushes it over the top."},{"CardName":"Spark Reaper","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’ve liked this in the average black deck, though if you’re light on amass or creatures in general, it’s fine to cut it. The rating goes up a fair bit if you can build around it, but even as just a value card it tends to pull its weight. It’s also great at eating planeswalkers that are stuck at 1 loyalty, which happens fairly often."},{"CardName":"Tithebearer Giant","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is another one that I play most of the time, though it’s expensive enough that I rarely pick it early. Tithebearer Giant adds to the board nicely and replaces itself, which is pretty good for a card you can pick up 10th pick."},{"CardName":"Toll of the Invasion","Rating":"2.5","Description":"This takes a toll on slow decks, and thanks to amass 1, does respectably well against faster ones too. Getting a token or a +1/+1 counter is almost exactly enough to take this effect from sideboard to main deck, and I’d play this almost every time."},{"CardName":"Unlikely Aid","Rating":"1.0","Description":"If you’ve got a very aggressive deck and need a combat trick, this, well, does the trick. It’s unlikely that I’ll play this very often, and you can basically get the card for free, so don’t worry about taking it early."},{"CardName":"Vampire Opportunist","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This random Vampire won’t actually have many opportunities in this set, as a 2-mana 2/1 is quite bad in the format (amass really owns it), and the expensive activated ability doesn’t come up often. I’d avoid unless you really need a 2-drop or expect the game to stall out."},{"CardName":"Vizier of the Scorpion","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I take this behind the good common removal, though there are matchups where it really delivers. This card more incentivizes you to spread out your amass card more than most, and only playing a new one after trading off the token. Note that if they kill the Vizier mid-combat you lose deathtouch and subsequently, the battle."},{"CardName":"Vraska's Finisher","Rating":"2.5","Description":"This effect has never been better. The fact that this snipes planeswalkers means that the opponent will almost always block, at which point you can use this to finish off their creature. The only decks I don’t like this in are the heavy control ones, as those tend to run light on creatures."},{"CardName":"Ahn-Crop Invader","Rating":"3.0","Description":"It takes a little work to make Ahn-Crop Invader perform at full potential, but in red-black sacrifice or red-white aggro this is a beater. You do have to avoid going all-in when the opponent has mana untapped, but it can usually get in for solid damage without having to be fed. I also wish this was bad so I could call it the Ahn-Crap Invader, but it’s way too good to deserve that moniker."},{"CardName":"Blindblast","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Blindblast occupies a weird spot. It’s not an intrinsically powerful card, but in the right deck it does a good job checking some boxes. It can pick off small creatures, but there aren’t tons of those that really matter (amass tokens aren’t exactly must-kills), and removing blockers doesn’t matter as much as just drawing a card and being a spell. The decks that want this are mostly the spells-matter decks, though aggressive decks can play this if needed. The grade reflects how often you cut the card, even if I never feel too bad about playing this because it replaces itself."},{"CardName":"Bolt Bend","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"In a deck with a lot of 4-power creatures, Bolt Bend is a very strong spell. Sure, it may not have many targets in the opposing deck but when you do land it, it completely destroys the opponent. Making a removal spell hit their own creature for 1 mana is an incredible swing, and worth sometimes having a dead card in hand. This is a card that highly relies on the opponent’s deck, so side it out aggressively if you don’t see any targets."},{"CardName":"Bond of Passion","Rating":"2.0","Description":"At 6 mana, Bond is a pricey number, even if it kills planeswalkers quite effectively. It’s a little too expensive to reliably be part of the sacrifice-themed deck, so I’d mostly look to use this as a curve-topper in aggressive decks."},{"CardName":"Burning Prophet","Rating":"2.5","Description":"It’s not hard to pick up 7-8 noncreature spells, at which point this becomes a solid addition. Once you get above 10, Burning Prophet is great, and in both cases it benefits from the lack of good 2-drops in the set."},{"CardName":"Chainwhip Cyclops","Rating":"1.5","Description":"There’s no shortage of 5+ drops, as usual, so I wouldn’t describe this one as off the chain. If you need an expensive card, I’d keep an eye out for this, but it’s rarely a priority."},{"CardName":"Chandra, Fire Artisan","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Chandra is a brutal play when you’re ahead, and can even turn the tables when you’re behind, depending on the situation. The most common sequence is that you play her, +1, and she gets attacked for a couple points next turn. You then get to untap with her in play and protect her from there, leaving you with a powerful card draw machine. Note that you can play lands off her ability, so you usually want to use it first thing each turn. Her passive ability is great too, as she punishes the opponent hard for attacking her, and can take down opposing planeswalkers easily. Chandra is a great card, and one I’ll take early if I’m lucky enough to have the option."},{"CardName":"Chandra's Pyrohelix","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The first Pyrohelix is pretty good, but these aren’t great in multiples, as they run out of targets quickly. This format doesn’t revolve around small creatures, so it’s not unthinkable that you’d side this out if the opponent is light on targets."},{"CardName":"Chandra's Triumph","Rating":"3.5","Description":"The difference between 2 and 3 damage is big, and Chandra’s Triumph is a great piece of removal. It does the job you want, and does it efficiently."},{"CardName":"Cyclops Electromancer","Rating":"1.5/3.5","Description":"This scales up pretty quickly once you hit 7 spells, and at 13+ it essentially becomes a Flametongue Kavu. That’s a good build-around if I’ve ever seen one, and makes Cyclops Electromancer worth speculating on early."},{"CardName":"Demolish","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Demolish is in every set and not once have I sided it in."},{"CardName":"Devouring Hellion","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Red-black and red-blue both enable the sacrifice deck well enough, largely thanks to amass. Note that this can eat planeswalkers too, and devouring one with 1 loyalty that’s just sitting there can be effective. I’m a little lower on Devouring Hellion than I would be if the removal in this set wasn’t so good, and I’d usually recommend against going all-in early."},{"CardName":"Dreadhorde Arcanist","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Sometimes this goes up in value quite a bit, as it can really go nuts with pump spells or cards like Stealth Mission. If you have no ways to pump it or 1-drop spells, it’s nothing special, but most aggressive decks will find ways to use Dreadhorde Arcanist."},{"CardName":"Dreadhorde Twins","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Dreadhorde Twins isn’t bad, though it needs support to make it better than a red Call the Cavalry. The best place for this is a deck with Heartfire or other sacrifice cards, a heavy amass deck, or ideally both."},{"CardName":"Finale of Promise","Rating":"1.0/3.5","Description":"This is a promising build-around, and it’s basically a blue-red gold card. If you’ve got a healthy mix of instants and sorceries, this really delivers, and it triggers cards like Spellgorger Weird three times. That’s a lot of action, and Finale of Promise is one of the better reasons to be in the spells deck in the first place."},{"CardName":"Goblin Assailant","Rating":"1.0","Description":"When I say this format is short on good 2-drops, that doesn’t mean Goblin Assailant goes up in value. In fact, this is part of why the format is short on good 2-drops, as this certainly is not one."},{"CardName":"Goblin Assault Team","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The best use of Goblin Assault Team is to enable Raging Kronch or various 4-power synergies. It’s only got 1 toughness, so it won’t ever survive combat, but it at least takes something out with it."},{"CardName":"Grim Initiate","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’ve ended up playing Grim Initiate a lot more often than I thought I would. It provides just enough value between sacrifice cards and amass synergies, and I like this in most R/B or U/R decks (less so in R/W or R/G, though it can be passable there sometimes)."},{"CardName":"Heartfire","Rating":"2.0 // 3.0","Description":"In a deck with 3-4 good fodder cards, Heartfire is an excellent removal spell (or finisher). Most decks will want this, and some decks will really want it, as it pairs excellently with amass, Tibalt, and Tibalt’s Rager."},{"CardName":"Honor the God-Pharaoh","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I like how good the commons are in WAR. It’s not like Honor the God-Pharaoh is something special, but adding amass to Tormenting Voice really goes a long way. I’ve liked it in most red decks, especially those that care about spells and having creatures to sacrifice (which as you can see, is a lot of the space for red)."},{"CardName":"Ilharg, the Raze-Boar","Rating":"4.0","Description":"The worst God-Eternal is still great. Ilharg is enormous, attacks for a ton of trampling damage, and can bring friends along for the ride. This is well-suited to take out your opponent in a few short attacks, and even kings have been known to fall to the Raze-Boar. Note that the creature this puts in doesn’t return until EOT, so you may want to just cast it if you have a lot of mana and don’t care about attacking immediately."},{"CardName":"Invading Manticore","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is replaceable but powerful, and if you need a finisher, it doesn’t sting to have to play this. The cycle of 6-drops at common makes each individual one low-priority, as you want 1-2 cards of that cost at most."},{"CardName":"Jaya, Venerated Firemage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Jaya is a beating. Getting two Shocks plus a good passive (which makes your creatures deal more damage in combat, mind you) is a great deal for 5 mana. Jaya is a powerful splash, though she’s at her best in a heavy-red deck. She’s also very good with Chandra’s Pyrohelix, as it deals 2 damage to two targets (or 3 to one) with her passive around."},{"CardName":"Jaya's Greeting","Rating":"3.5","Description":"You can’t go wrong with Jaya’s Greeting, and it’s certainly the best red common. It takes out most creatures that cost 4 or less, and even nets you a scry while you’re at it."},{"CardName":"Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Krenko gets out of control really quickly. If you play him early, he is a must-answer, and if you have one removal spell the opponent may just die to the Goblin hoard. He also scales really nicely with pump spells (any Goblin Stealth Missions?), and even later in the game it’s a card you have to watch out for. He gets high marks for the runaway potential, and is a card I’d be happy to take early."},{"CardName":"Mizzium Tank","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m not a big fan of Mizzium Tank. In a spell-heavy deck, it’s still worse than Spellgorger Weird, though it’s an acceptable payoff. In a deck without a lot of spells, it’s nigh-unplayable, leaving it in the mediocre build-around camp."},{"CardName":"Nahiri's Stoneblades","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Every now and then, a spell deck that is lacking in spells will play this, but it’s a marginal card at best. Of all cards to call the stoneblade, this is not what I would have picked."},{"CardName":"Neheb, Dreadhorde Champion","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Neheb is huge, hits for a lot of damage, and can let you cycle through all of your bad cards. That’s a great deal for 4 mana, and not one I’m going to pass up."},{"CardName":"Raging Kronch","Rating":"3.0","Description":"KRONCH! This card is both funny and good, and does a great job in any aggressive deck. Note that it can block without any help, so don’t go attacking into any Kronches, wild or not."},{"CardName":"Samut's Sprint","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Like Nahiri’s Stoneblades, I’d save Samut’s Sprint for a spells-matter deck, though you can also play it in a very aggressive deck in a pinch."},{"CardName":"Sarkhan the Masterless","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Sarkhan gives you a 4/4 Dragon at the very worst, and his other abilities are definitely relevant too. He stops x/1s from attacking, can let your planeswalkers alpha strike, and eventually makes a second Dragon if the game somehow lasts long enough. Sarkhan is one of the bigger bombs in the set, and I’d recommend slamming him if that’s an option."},{"CardName":"Sarkhan's Catharsis","Rating":"1.0","Description":"The best use for Sarkhan’s Catharsis is to side it in against planeswalkers, though an extremely aggressive deck may just want it as a finisher. As cathartic as it may feel, killing a planeswalker they’ve already used isn’t all that great, but you do need to get Ugin or Liliana off the board somehow."},{"CardName":"Spellgorger Weird","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Spellgorger Weird is awesome in this set. It’s very well-supported and goes in the best red archetype. I’d take this early and often, and it’s not crazy to take this over Jaya’s Greeting once you are firmly in U/R spells."},{"CardName":"Tibalt, Rakish Instigator","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Tibalt is a little too good for my tastes. Making two 1/1 Devils is a fantastic deal for 3 mana, though not so good that I’d call it a deal with the devil. Proliferate sometimes stretches that to three Devils, and these sacrifice to Heartfire perfectly (as does Tibalt). This is great in any red deck save the most aggressive ones, and especially good in R/B sacrifice."},{"CardName":"Tibalt's Rager","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The pump ability really sells Tibalt’s Rager, as it allows it to trade up easily in the late game. This is another great creature to sacrifice, and another reason red’s themes are reinforced so well."},{"CardName":"Turret Ogre","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is a very powerful common, especially compared to something like Summit Prowler. That said, it doesn’t fit super well into some of the red decks, so I bench it more often than I thought I would. Format considerations matter, and Turret Ogre doesn’t play well with sacrifice or spells, red’s two biggest themes."},{"CardName":"Arboreal Grazer","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Despite losing to this at the Mythic Championship (turn 2 Trusted Pegasus got me good), I would highly recommend against playing it. An 0/3 and an extra land drop is not worth a card, even with reach, and there’s not much that this can do to make it worth running. Maybe a G/B sacrifice deck that needs more fodder, but that also is a reach."},{"CardName":"Arlinn, Voice of the Pack","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Arlinn is not only the voice of the pack, she’s the whole pack in one card. She is a little soft to flyers, but unimpeded puts three 3/3 Wolves into play, while pumping any stray Arlinn’s Wolves you also happen to cast. Note that if you use her -2 and she dies, the ensuing Wolf will not get a +1/+1 counter. Arlinn is also awesome with proliferate, as she gets counters and so do all of her Wolves."},{"CardName":"Arlinn's Wolf","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’ve liked Arlinn’s Wolf well enough. Dodging 2/x creatures is surprisingly strong on a 3/2, as this tends to trade up more often than not. It also threatens planeswalkers nicely, and is a fine way to fill out your curve."},{"CardName":"Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Unchecked, this card wins the game very quickly—a 9/9 haste is a beating. It sadly does lack trample, which means the opponent can sometimes chump, then kill or bounce it, but every time they don’t they lose in a matter of turns. It’s also an instant, so you can ambush opposing attackers if that’s a better use."},{"CardName":"Band Together","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Band Together is a fine removal spell, and has a couple of things that make it stand out compared to cards like Pounce. First of all, it’s a sucker punch, not a fight—the enemy creature doesn’t hit back. It also lets you combine forces, which not only lets you kill bigger creatures, but gives you backup in case of removal (if you punch their 3/3 with two of yours, they need two removal spells to get out of it). Note that this works well with deathtouch and lifelink too."},{"CardName":"Bloom Hulk","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Each color got a pushed common, and green’s is definitely Bloom Hulk. This offers a ton of stats naturally, and pairs very nicely with any sort of counters, of which there are many. I like this in any green deck, and once the proliferate really starts popping, this becomes an easy early pick."},{"CardName":"Bond of Flourishing","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Bond is a solid bit of card selection, and the 3 life doesn’t hurt. Unless your deck is particularly spell-heavy, I’d always run this, and it’s a great way to use your mana on turn 2 (or any other turn where you’re not curving out)."},{"CardName":"Centaur Nurturer","Rating":"2.0","Description":"In the 5-color green deck, Centaur Nurturer rockets up in value, but in a normal 2-color deck that isn’t ramping super hard, this is nothing special. If you want these, you can usually get them."},{"CardName":"Challenger Troll","Rating":"3.5","Description":"New Troll here! Challenger Troll is a beating by itself, and it even does something as soon as it comes down by making your other big guns harder to block effectively. This is exactly what you want in most green decks, and can close out games quite well."},{"CardName":"Courage in Crisis","Rating":"3.0","Description":"At a base level, Courage in Crisis is nothing special. It’s two +1/+1 counters, and at sorcery speed. But this set is made to optimize proliferate, and Courage in Crisis is often worth 4+ counters, making it a huge swing. I take this highly in G/W proliferate, and it has its moments in any color combination once you hit four or five cards that combo with it."},{"CardName":"Evolution Sage","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Evolution Sage is a near-bomb, as it gives you a ton of value for very little investment. This snowballs wildly if you can put a counter or two on your creatures, and plays a lot closer to Tireless Tracker than you might think. If you are lucky enough to start with Evolution Sage, you can usually draft a pretty sick proliferate deck."},{"CardName":"Finale of Devastation","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Despite an early misread of what Finale of Devastation does (Matt Nass lied to me and told me it got a creature from both your deck and graveyard), I now know how this works, and it isn’t good. Paying a 2 mana premium on top of your creature’s cost isn’t worth it, and I’d only play this if I had some nuts creatures and was short on playables."},{"CardName":"Forced Landing","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Forced Landing is perfectly good sideboard material, and you aren’t forced to main deck it in this format."},{"CardName":"Giant Growth","Rating":"1.5","Description":"WAR is not the format for Giant Growth, despite +3/+3 for 1 mana looking like a great deal. It just happens that this doesn’t work in 5-Color Green, isn’t a +1/+1 counter trick for the proliferate decks, and often ends up on the chopping block as a result. If you’re playing an aggressive deck and don’t care about proliferate, Giant Growth is a fine option, but it’s not the all-star it used to be."},{"CardName":"God-Eternal Rhonas","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Rhonas doesn’t disappoint. It’s a 5/5 unkillable, deathtouch monster for 5, and makes all of your creatures hit very hard for a turn (though note that it doesn’t help them survive any better). It can also work to trade Rhonas off late game so you get the ETB effect again once you redraw it. The God-Eternals are pretty silly, and even as one of the lesser ones, Rhonas delivers."},{"CardName":"Jiang Yanggu, Wildcrafter","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’m not as high on Jiang as some people. I find him to be a little too vulnerable for my tastes, and once he’s killed, all your bonus mana goes away. Sure, if you curve out and can protect Jiang, he gives you a big advantage, but I’ve had enough games where that doesn’t happen that I’m no longer treating him as a great card."},{"CardName":"Kraul Stinger","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Kraul Stinger is a better blocker than attacker, and in both cases is rarely a high pick (it definitely stings to take this early). If you need more creatures, this can fill out your curve, but don’t go nuts over it."},{"CardName":"Kronch Wrangler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"KRONCH (Wrangler)! The Wrangler is great in all but the most controlling green decks, as it’s hard not to have 3+ creatures that trigger it, and like the card suggests, it’s excellent in the R/G Kronch archetype. Trample kicks in once this grows, and it even picks up some nice proliferate synergy once it starts getting bigger."},{"CardName":"Mowu, Loyal Companion","Rating":"3.5","Description":"More like Mowow, amiright? Mowu gets really big, really fast, and all you need is something tons of commons in multiple colors provide. Mowu is worth building around, and doesn’t even take much dedication—a few ways to gain counters and you’re in business."},{"CardName":"New Horizons","Rating":"2.5","Description":"New Horizons is much better than it initially looked. It provides a +1/+1 counter for proliferate purposes and color fixing in a format where 3+ colors is viable, which makes it a desirable common for most green decks."},{"CardName":"Nissa, Who Shakes the World","Rating":"4.5","Description":"You can definitely count on Nissa to shake up any game she’s involved in. Making a 3/3 every turn is big, and doubling the mana from your Forests means you will be able to deploy the rest of your cards while using your 3/3s to brawl. You can do some neat stuff by untapping Forests, but regardless of how you use Nissa, you’ll end up ahead."},{"CardName":"Nissa's Triumph","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Nissa’s Triumph costing double-green is pretty awkward, as it means this doesn’t fix colors, just total mana. I’d only play this in a heavy green deck that has a high curve, and it’s generally worse than other options on the table."},{"CardName":"Paradise Druid","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Paradise Druid fixes for every color, which is awesome in the 5-color decks and great even in a 2-color deck. You know it’s going to survive, too, and if you really need it for something down the line you can avoid tapping it."},{"CardName":"Planewide Celebration","Rating":"3.5","Description":"All of the modes on Planewide Celebration are good in different situations, which makes this the ever-desirable combo of powerful and flexible. Getting back a permanent is the most powerful usually, though since it doesn’t affect the board, you usually combine it with making some 2/2s. If the board lends itself, proliferating can be great too, and in a pinch the life gain can keep you alive. I’d look to draft a more controlling deck if I had this, as it closes out games nicely."},{"CardName":"Pollenbright Druid","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Pollenbright Druid looks innocuous, but it’s impressive. It’s a 2/2 for 2 early and can really amp up your board once you’ve gotten some +1/+1 counter action going, making it slot nicely at any point in the curve. This is one of the better green commons, and really rewards you for drafting a proliferate deck."},{"CardName":"Primordial Wurm","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If you need a 6-drop, Primordial Wurm will get the job done, even if it’s not the most exciting card to include."},{"CardName":"Return to Nature","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Strict sideboard material, Return to Nature is not a high priority, as this format doesn’t have tons of good targets."},{"CardName":"Snarespinner","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’ve seen bigger spiders, though Snarespinner wins the efficiency prize for sure. I really like this, as there is a dearth of good 2-drops, and this curves nicely into New Horizons. It’s good in all the defensive green decks, and is especially important for planeswalker protection."},{"CardName":"Steady Aim","Rating":"0.5","Description":"This definitely missed the mark. It doesn’t provide enough power to be worth it, and untapping the creature and giving it reach aren’t enough to salvage the card."},{"CardName":"Storm the Citadel","Rating":"1.0","Description":"+2/+2 at sorcery speed isn’t impressive, and turning all of your creatures into Trygon Predators for a turn does not make Storm the Citadel all that much more exciting. Overrun this is not, and if these are the tactics used, no wonder Bolas did so well."},{"CardName":"Thundering Ceratok","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Ceratok fits nicely into 4-power matters decks and is just a good deal on stats alone. I tend to be pretty happy playing this, and any additional synergies are a nice bonus."},{"CardName":"Vivien, Champion of the Wilds","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Vivien gives you a ton of value for 3 mana. She’s got one of the best passive abilities, and reliably draws you cards in a creature-heavy deck. What usually happens is that your opponent is forced to attack into Vivien, at which point you can flash in creatures and get your ambush on. Note that you can play exiled cards even if Vivien dies, so it’s almost impossible not to get something good out of this very cheap investment."},{"CardName":"Vivien's Arkbow","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Her Arkbow, on the other hand, is an expensive investment, and not a reliable one. When you hit, you still traded 1-for-1, after spending a card on the bow. That’s fine, but when you miss, you lost so much time and a lot of resources, making this a very bad bet (and leading to some very bad beats)."},{"CardName":"Vivien's Grizzly","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The Grizzly is a fine mana sink, and a decent way to gum up the ground. I usually want one of these in my slower green decks, and haven’t looked to play multiples."},{"CardName":"Wardscale Crocodile","Rating":"1.0","Description":"3 toughness is too low for my tastes, and I tend to sideboard Wardscale Crocodile more than main deck it. It’s just too small and too expensive, and this format isn’t about building a giant hexproof battlecruiser."},{"CardName":"Ajani, the Greathearted","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Ajani is a ridiculous card when ahead or at parity, but does suffer from needing a lot of creatures to truly be great. He won’t protect you when you don’t have a good squad, and that leads to some situations where he doesn’t quite live up to his full bomb status. That said, he’s still awesome, and better than any common or uncommon. I’d look to draft G/W Proliferate, and Ajani will be unbeatable in any of your good draws."},{"CardName":"Angrath's Rampage","Rating":"2.5","Description":"While I still don’t love edict effects in Limited because your opponent’s worst creature is often quite bad, this being able to pick off planeswalkers does help. The opponent will rarely have multiple planeswalkers in play, and a card that can hit a walker or creature does offer a lot of flexibility. Plus, sometimes you may actually want to kill an artifact, and this does that too."},{"CardName":"Bioessence Hydra","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Hydra into planeswalker is very hard to beat (I can verify, losing to that exact sequence in the Mythic Invitational), and this starts out as a burly 4/4. Trample helps a ton here too, and in a deck with 3+ planeswalkers this is an absurd card."},{"CardName":"Casualties of War","Rating":"3.5","Description":"The casting cost here is a doozy, which does make me hesitant to take this early. The rating is predicated on you already being black-green, and I wouldn’t hesitate to take one of the better commons over Casualties when you don’t know your colors yet. Once casting this isn’t an issue, it does do a lot of work, often taking out three cards (creature, land, and planeswalker being the most common). In some matchups it may even do more, though I’ve yet to see the fabled five-for-one."},{"CardName":"Cruel Celebrant","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"Cruel Celebrant is passable in any creature-heavy deck, but doesn’t become a high priority until you really commit to the B/W sacrifice deck. This plus Spark Reaper, Teyo, and Lazotep Reavers is an effective combination, and I have enjoyed when that deck comes together."},{"CardName":"Deathsprout","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Even if the casting cost is a little tricky, Deathsprout is not only in the right colors for tricky costs, but it helps cast other cards once you resolve it. I love this card in the B/G deck that splashes 2-3 other colors, and don’t mind starting with it from pack one. Killing any creature at instant speed is huge, and this fixes your mana quite nicely."},{"CardName":"Despark","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Despark is less good than it initially looked, but good enough to always play in B/W. I like it a little less than the good commons, as it misses more often than you might think, but it’s always nice to have as a backstop against ridiculous bombs (unless those bombs are God-Eternals, or Finales, or…)."},{"CardName":"Domri, Anarch of Bolas","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Domri does a lot of work for just 3 mana. First of all, you can often find a profitable fight to pick, especially with your creatures getting +1/+0. Even if you have to trade, you didn’t really spend a card on Domri (assuming you can protect him), so it’s still even on cards to have your 3/3 trade up for their 4/4. Domri also ramps you, and eventually builds up enough loyalty to fight again, so he’s not a one-and-done.\r\n\r\nDomri is dangerous early, and can snowball easily, while also being relevant late. That’s a lot for 3 mana, and makes Domri a great card even if the average case isn’t that much more than just a 3 mana fight card."},{"CardName":"Domri's Ambush","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Domri’s Ambush is a solid removal spell, and note that it isn’t a fight, it’s a punch, so their creature doesn’t hit back. This is great in red-green but not quite worth splashing, making it land about where good common removal does."},{"CardName":"Dovin's Veto","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I usually main deck Dovin’s Veto in this format, thanks to all the planeswalkers, but I don’t hesitate to side it out if the opponent doesn’t have a lot of targets."},{"CardName":"Dreadhorde Butcher","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Dreadhorde Butcher gets out of control if you land it early, and even late game it’s a Footlight Fiend at the very least. That’s a solid playable, though not something that would put me into black-red early."},{"CardName":"Elite Guardmage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This Guardmage may be Elite, but blue-white tends not to be. I do like that this is easily splashable, and powerful enough to be worth it. This delivers a solid card-and-a-half worth of value, and is good at basically any stage in the game, so seeing one pick five or six does bias me towards U/W, even if that isn’t where I’d like to start."},{"CardName":"Enter the God-Eternals","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Enter the God-Eternals does it all. It slices (a creature), it dices (their deck), and it leaves you with a 4/4 plus 4 life. That’s a ton of value, and well worth 5 mana. This is the perfect card when you’re behind, while also being awesome when you’re ahead, and is something I’d definitely try to splash in any blue deck."},{"CardName":"Feather, the Redeemed","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Feather is less splashable, since a ton of her value is in being a cheap 3/4 flyer. She has some neat combos with various red and white commons too, making her both a powerful card in her own right as well as a rewarding build-around."},{"CardName":"Gleaming Overseer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I love Gleaming Overseer. A 1/4 plus a 1/1 is already good value, and this often pumps your amass token into something respectable. At that point, having hexproof and menace means that you’re rewarded for piling on tokens, and U/B is very good at doing so. This is great no matter how you use it, and enables both a sacrifice theme and a go-big amass theme."},{"CardName":"Heartwarming Redemption","Rating":"1.5","Description":"As heartwarming as this may be, Boros is aggressive enough that this effect doesn’t quite fit. It is powerful, as replacing itself means you aren’t losing card advantage, and cycling your hand and gaining 4-5 life is a sweet effect, so I’d be inclined to run this in any midrange or control deck where the colors work out."},{"CardName":"Huatli's Raptor","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Once you are firmly in the G/W proliferate deck, Huatli’s Raptor is awesome. You don’t actually want to drop it on turn 2 most of the time, as it’s at its most clever when you play it on turn 5 along side other proliferate or +1/+1 counter effects."},{"CardName":"Invade the City","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"In a heavy U/R spells deck, Invade the City sometimes is better than Relentless Advance, and that’s a pretty low bar. I don’t much like this as a build-around, and while I will begrudgingly play it if I’m at 15+ spells, it’s definitely not an early pick."},{"CardName":"Leyline Prowler","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I love when the 2-color card perfectly encapsulates that color pair’s strategy, and Leyline Prowler gets high marks on that metric. It enables 5-color GB, providing mana fixing, ramp, and a good body for brawling. This is great on turn 3 and still good on turn 7, making it exactly what these ramp decks need."},{"CardName":"Living Twister","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Living Twister is a nightmare to play against. You have to play as if the opponent is always holding a handful of Shocks, because they basically are, and that makes double-blocking or even deciding what to play extremely difficult. It’s also tough enough that many cards can’t take it down, meaning it’s definitely sticking around and making things difficult. This is worth taking early and worth splashing, and does particularly well with card draw, as it efficiently converts resources for you."},{"CardName":"Mayhem Devil","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Mayhem Devil falls into the Huatli’s Raptor bucket—it’s great in its color pair, but not worth splashing. It enables sacrifice decks nicely, and even punishes the opponent for sacrificing, but isn’t something I want to commit to in the first couple picks."},{"CardName":"Merfolk Skydiver","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I love Merfolk Skydiver. All by itself, it’s a 2/2 flyer for 2 that grows itself, and the ceiling is much higher than that. It crushes in proliferate-heavy decks while being great in any deck, which is a card I like starting with. It’s also worth splashing if you’re really going deep on proliferate, as the effect is powerful even in the late game."},{"CardName":"Neoform","Rating":"1.0","Description":"We aren’t quite on the topic of Constructed, though it’s clear at this point that Neoform delivers there (mostly Griselbrands, piping hot to your door). In Limited, I’d only play this if I had a really tight curve, a lot of sacrifice fodder, and some really good hits. That’s not going to be often, though I saw Josh Utter-Leyton draft a pretty sweet Simic Proliferate deck that sacrificed Iron Bully to go get some powerful 4-drops."},{"CardName":"Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Bolas is an obscenely powerful card, but also a very difficult card to cast. I don’t recommend slamming Bolas and diving headfirst into Grixis, but if you see Bolas after taking a few black cards, it is possible to cast. You want to be heavy black, with blue and red as splashes, and prioritize fixers. Being able to -3 to kill anything and +1 to draw a card plus tax them for a card is awesome, and sometimes this even hijacks the abilities of other planeswalkers (though there aren’t many that do it better than Bolas). The power here is worth it, and fixing does make it possible, but you likely should keep yourself open to begin with, and only move into Bolas territory if you see him a little later."},{"CardName":"Niv-Mizzet Reborn","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Niv is just a little too hard to realistically cast, as all five colors is quite the ask. I would need 5+ multicolor fixers to even attempt this, and even then, it’s a hard-to-cast 6/6 flyer that may draw you a card. That’s a lot of effort for not a huge payoff—save this one for showing off."},{"CardName":"Oath of Kaya","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Even a sorcery-speed Lightning Helix is great, and Oath of Kaya’s passive ability is quite strong. It’s easy to get another 4-6 points of life drain out of it, making this a fantastic card."},{"CardName":"Pledge of Unity","Rating":"3.5","Description":"All Pledge of Unity requires to be good is a creature-heavy deck, as permanent mass pump with life gain attached is great. Once you add in a few ways to proliferate, Pledge becomes one of the best cards in your deck, and is exactly what G/W is looking for."},{"CardName":"Ral, Storm Conduit","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Ral has blown me away. I first thought he would be just OK, but the combination of super high loyalty and a really powerful -2 has me convinced. You do want 5+ spells in your deck to really take advantage of Ral, and once you do he becomes a bomb. He also pings other planeswalkers nicely, and doubling up on any bounce or removal spell keeps him well-protected."},{"CardName":"Ral's Outburst","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Ral’s Outburst gives you a nice bit of card advantage attached to your removal spell, and is a card I’d take early, never cut, and even splash for. Note that if the target is removed (bounced, sacrificed, etc), you don’t draw the card, so if you need the card then you should point this at the opponent’s face."},{"CardName":"Roalesk, Apex Hybrid","Rating":"5.0","Description":"Roalesk really is the gift that keeps on giving. Not only do you get a 5 mana 4/5 flying, trample, but you get two +1/+1 counters immediately and a double proliferate upon exit. That’s an insane amount of stats for 5 mana, and Roalesk is just ridiculous as a result. It’s basically a flying Verdurous Gearhulk, which is high praise indeed."},{"CardName":"Role Reversal","Rating":"3.5","Description":"The grade on Role Reversal is undoubtedly much higher than many people would expect, especially given how mediocre cards like Switcheroo tended to be. There are a few things going on that make this a great card:\r\n\r\nIt’s cheap—3 mana is not a lot to invest.\nAmass gives you a lot of 1/1 junkers to trade to the opponent.\nThere are a lot of decks that look to buff their creatures, and often have one enormous threat in play.\nSwapping planeswalkers is very powerful, especially if you have one that is almost used up and doesn’t have a plus ability.\r\n\r\nAdd all that together and Role Reversal becomes a great card, and one well worth enabling. I’d try to have some amass and a few planeswalkers to really maximize it, though I’ve yet to find a U/R deck that doesn’t want it."},{"CardName":"Rubblebelt Rioters","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The Rioters are a strong threat, even if they do need a little help. Note that if they are the biggest creature, they will look at their own power, so pump spells do play here. I like Rioters in any creature-heavy R/G deck, but am generally not looking to splash them."},{"CardName":"Solar Blaze","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This rating is predicated on you drafting a controlling deck, and often one thats 3+ colors. That’s where Solar Blaze really shines, as it doesn’t fit all that well in an aggressive R/W deck. You can also attack into bigger creatures before playing this, and note that any deathtouch creature kills itself no matter what."},{"CardName":"Sorin, Vengeful Bloodlord","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Sorin is a beast. He has a ton of loyalty, gives you a ton of life due to his passive, and can pick off opposing planeswalkers nicely. He also lets you spend his loyalty well, bringing back all sorts of creatures over the course of the game. I’ve been very impressed by Sorin, and wouldn’t hesitate to splash him."},{"CardName":"Soul Diviner","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Soul Diviner is a bit of a build-around, but due to the makeup of the set, it doesn’t take a whole lot of work to do so. It’ll be great in your average U/B deck, as it takes counters off amass tokens as well as planeswalkers, and at 2/3 for 2, can even brawl well."},{"CardName":"Storrev, Devkarin Lich","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Storrev has actually underperformed for me a little, largely thanks to the tricky casting cost. So much of Storrev’s value is in slamming him early, and on turn 6+ he gets dealt with by commons like Invading Manticore or Kiora’s Dambreaker. That said, this is still a hyper-efficient beater that can draw you cards when it connects, so I’m still taking Storrev early."},{"CardName":"Tamiyo, Collector of Tales","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Tamiyo is another card that’s better than she looks. She brings back any card with her -3, and if you can protect her, the +1 will eventually hit. The first place to start is naming any card you have multiples of, but if you need a specific card to survive, or win the game, feel free to name that instead. Her passive is also a nice one, and I’ve seen Toll of the Invasion get bricked hard by Tamiyo before."},{"CardName":"Teferi, Time Raveler","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Teferi is essentially an Arrester’s Admonition with upside, which is pretty sweet. Thanks to proliferate, you can often get a second bounce out of Teferi, at which point he did a ton of work for you, and even if it’s just one bounce + you save a few life, he did only cost 3 mana. It’s also nice not having to worry about combat tricks, thanks to his passive, and sometimes you even get to play a sweet sorcery at instant speed."},{"CardName":"Tenth District Legionnaire","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The rating here goes up a little bit once you are already in Boros Aggro, especially if you have a couple combat tricks. I wouldn’t want to start with this, because it is pretty narrow, but it’s powerful once you are going down that road."},{"CardName":"Time Wipe","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Time Wipe is really sweet. Wrath + Rescue is a cute combo, and it’s absurd how much better a sweeper gets when you don’t have to telegraph it. Your opponent won’t know it’s coming, given that you get to play out your best creature still, and the tables turn rather quickly once the board gets wiped. This card is great and easily worth splashing."},{"CardName":"Tolsimir, Friend to Wolves","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Tolsimir delivers to you, as long as what you ordered is an extremely angry Wolf. He puts a ton of stats into play, and eats a 2/2 or trades for a 3/3, all of which is great. You can choose not to fight as well, which occasionally comes up."},{"CardName":"Tyrant's Scorn","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Smother + Unsummon is a fine combination, but I’m not jumping into U/B early just because of this. I like picking this up mid-pack, as it isn’t a bomb uncommon or a gold card worth committing to."},{"CardName":"Widespread Brutality","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Widespread Brutality is very similar to Time Wipe, and effective for many of the same reasons. This even lets you attack right away with the creature you keep, assuming you already have an amass token out, and you can sometimes maneuver things so this doesn’t kill your biggest creatures. Of course, sometimes you won’t be able to kill your opponent’s biggest creatures either, which is a risk you take."},{"CardName":"Angrath, Captain of Chaos","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Angrath is a menacing card, both in form and function. Making a 2/2 (or buffing an amass token) is a good -2, and giving your squad menace makes killing opposing planeswalkers very easy. Angrath is at his best in aggressive decks, but is still a totally fine defensive card, and gets bonus points for being hybrid (as all of this cycle does)."},{"CardName":"Ashiok, Dream Render","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I really like Ashiok in some matchups, or in a deck that does a good job defending itself. I wouldn’t just jam Ashiok in any random deck, because it doesn’t affect the board at all."},{"CardName":"Dovin, Hand of Control","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’ve got to hand it to Dovin—he does a really good Icy Manipulator impression. I especially like Dovin with proliferate and other planeswalkers to protect, as you do need to be doing something in order to gain an advantage from Dovin. Plus, his passive sometimes really messes the opponent up, and overall Dovin provides more than enough value to make the cut."},{"CardName":"Huatli, the Sun's Heart","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Huatli is a nice build-around, and really goes off with Charity Extractor. You often won’t want to even use the -3, and she survives pretty well with 7 loyalty. I like her in B/W decks the most, though I’ve seen G/W be able to use her well enough."},{"CardName":"Kaya, Bane of the Dead","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Kaya is one of the cards I most want to first pick, due to her combination of power (high) and flexibility (very high). Hybrid mana means that Kaya can be played in any color combination that includes white or black, and given that she picks off two creatures, is a card I want in any deck. She even cuts through Lazotep Plating, a mistake I’ve seen many people make. I get asked Draft picks on Twitter frequently, and my most common answer is “take the Kaya”."},{"CardName":"Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner","Rating":"1.5 // 3.5","Description":"Kiora is basically a green card, given how few blue creatures are large enough to get you that extra card. She is fantastic as long as you have 5+ ways to trigger her, as she starts with a lot of loyalty and generates a good bit of extra mana (bonus points for combining her with New Horizons)."},{"CardName":"Nahiri, Storm of Stone","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Nahiri is rock solid, and good in both aggressive and defensive decks. Giving all your creatures first strike is an excellent way to push in attacks, and killing tapped creatures helps defend you nicely. She is a great combo with Law Rune Enforcer too, so keep that in mind."},{"CardName":"Saheeli, Sublime Artificer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"In a spell-heavy U/R deck, Saheeli is great. She won’t close out a game by herself, but she gives you a ton of ground blockers, and her -2 can let you hit for extra damage if you have something big in play. I like Saheeli with 9+ ways to trigger her, and bonus points if some of those are card draw, to keep the spells flowing."},{"CardName":"Samut, Tyrant Smasher","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Samut is only good when you are pressuring the opponent, though she does perform well in that spot. I’d look to be R/G with large monsters, and treat Samut as a temporary speed boost."},{"CardName":"Vraska, Swarm's Eminence","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Vraska is another card I find myself first-picking frequently. Making two 1/1 super deathtouchers is great for 4 mana, and with proliferate you may even get a third sometimes. She also punishes the opponent for not blocking your 1/1s, and given her hybrid cost, can show up basically anywhere."},{"CardName":"Karn, the Great Creator","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"Karn is a weird one. The best use I can imagine for him is to have a God-Pharaoh’s Statue and a Saheeli’s Silverwing in the board, making Karn a bizarre sort of Divination. I’m not sure how feasible that is, but you’ll likely be able to pick up all the pieces on the cheap."},{"CardName":"Ugin, the Ineffable","Rating":"5.0","Description":"Ugin nabs a coveted perfect score thanks to being colorless. This goes in any deck, and is the safest/best first pick in the set. The combination of abilities is excellent, with both the -3 and +1 being good in just about any situation. The fact that the 2/2s draw you cards when they die is a nice cherry on top, and I’ve found that Ugin delivers."},{"CardName":"Ugin's Conjurant","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I think Ugin’s Conjurant might be the most underrated card in the set. People read the drawback of taking damage as permanent -1/-1 and think the card is crap, when it’s anything but. First of all, it’s an X spell where X is good at any number (though four or five is the sweet spot), making it flexible. It can be a 3-drop if you have an expensive hand or a 7-drop if you’re flooding out. It also works very well with proliferate, and the ability does prevent damage, so it’s immune to deathtouch. All that added together makes this a great early pick and a card I’m happy with in any deck."},{"CardName":"Firemind Vessel","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"In a normal 2-color deck, this is crap. It’s too expensive and doesn’t affect the board until way too late. In a 3+ color deck, especially one with some expensive bombs, it becomes a strong enabler, though I tend to prefer the Mana Geode."},{"CardName":"God-Pharaoh's Statue","Rating":"0.5","Description":"The Statue is way too expensive to be good, though the effect is so miserable that it’s surely by design. I can see siding this in against someone with a lot of expensive cards, and there is the Karn combo I talked about earlier, but you should be able to pick this up for free most drafts."},{"CardName":"Guild Globe","Rating":"2.5 // 3.0","Description":"I like Guild Globe, and am happy playing it in 2-color decks if they have a lot of double mana costs. It also triggers cards like Spellgorger Weird, and overall has a pretty low opportunity cost. In a 3+ color deck it becomes even better, and those decks will nab these as soon as they can."},{"CardName":"Iron Bully","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Iron Bully takes a little work to be good. In a deck with heavy proliferate it can be quite menacing, but it’s otherwise too expensive for what you get."},{"CardName":"Mana Geode","Rating":"2.0 // 3.0","Description":"Like the other fixers, I wouldn’t really look to play Mana Geode in a 2-color deck, but it shines once you are getting a little more wild."},{"CardName":"Prismite","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I really dislike Prismite. It’s expensive fixing, a mediocre body, and good at basically no point in the game."},{"CardName":"Saheeli's Silverwing","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The Silverwing gets a bad rap. Don’t get me wrong, the card isn’t great, but it can attack planeswalkers well enough. I’d play this if I really needed a flyer, and leave it at home if you don’t."},{"CardName":"Blast Zone","Rating":"3.0","Description":"All of the lands are somewhat similar in that they are strong playables that don’t count against your spell slots. Blast Zone does a good job of punishing the opponent for having too many cards of the same cost, and can also scare them into playing out their hand differently than they’d want to. Note that this is one of the few cards in the set where the opponent may choose to proliferate onto it, so don’t be caught unawares if they do."},{"CardName":"Emergence Zone","Rating":"0.5","Description":"I don’t think my mana can ever get good enough to justify playing Emergence Zone. The effect is just too minor to give up a colored source."},{"CardName":"Gateway Plaza","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Gateway Plaza is mediocre in 2-color decks and great in 3+ color decks, just like previous cards. Having your land cost 2 mana is rough, so it’s only worth it if you’re really going deep."},{"CardName":"Interplanar Beacon","Rating":"1.5","Description":"You’d need a lot of planeswalkers before this becomes better than a basic land, and ideally they span 3+ colors as well."},{"CardName":"Karn's Bastion","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Karn’s Bastion has a very powerful effect, and can win a game from a stalemate quite easily. Almost any deck will want this, and in a heavy proliferate deck, it’s nearly a bomb."},{"CardName":"Mobilized District","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Mobilized District is a nice way to get value from a land, and often worth playing as the 18th land. It taps for mana until you need it to trade off, and can even pressure the opponent if you have a land-heavy draw.\r\n\r\nWhew. The journey was longer than anticipated, but we did get to the end. Thanks for bearing with me, and I’ll be back soon with Constructed!\r\n\r\nLSV"}],"TopCommonCardsByColor":{"W":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"War Screecher"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Wanderer’s Strike"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Divine Arrow"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Law-Rune Enforcer"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Trusted Pegasus"}],"U":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Erratic Visionary"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Callous Dismissal"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Thunder Drake"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Tamiyo’s Epiphany"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Aven Eternal"}],"B":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Vraska’s Finisher"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Herald of the Dreadhorde"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Lazotep Reaver"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Spark Harvest"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Ob Nixilis’s Cruelty"}],"R":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Heartfire"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Ahn-Crop Invader"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Raging Kronch"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Spellgorger Weird"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Jaya’s Greeting"}],"G":[{"Rank":5,"Name":"Kronch Wrangler"},{"Rank":4,"Name":"Courage in Crisis"},{"Rank":3,"Name":"Pollenbright Druid"},{"Rank":2,"Name":"Band Together"},{"Rank":1,"Name":"Bloom Hulk"}]}},"RNA":{"Ratings":[{"CardName":"Angelic Exaltation","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This one is a little hard to nail down because I’m not sure what the average Azorius/Orzhov deck will look like, but it’s a powerful effect if you have 14+ creatures in your deck. If you can get +3/+3, the card is quite strong, and it’s not that hard to imagine getting there."},{"CardName":"Angel of Grace","Rating":"4.5","Description":"It doesn’t get much better than this. Not only is this a huge flash flyer that is cheap and great at ambushing, it can also save you in even the most dire situations. You could take a lot away from this card and it would still be great, which is a sign of a true bomb. If you draw this early, you can pick off an attacker and start smashing the opponent. Later in the game, it saves you from lethal, and you may even want to trade this off (or chump) so that you can go back up to 10 on your next turn. This is a great card, and one that does well in almost any situation."},{"CardName":"Archway Angel","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"This is a build-around for sure, as you need to gain 4+ life before it’s worth paying 6 for a 3/4 flyer. I’m excited about the Gate deck, as it looks like it’s getting a lot of solid payoffs this time around."},{"CardName":"Arrester's Zeal","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I like Arrester’s Zeal quite a bit. 1 mana for a +2/+2 is usually a solid playable, and giving it potential as a finisher really pushes this over the top. The only thing that quenches my zeal a little is that both Azorius and Orzhov have some defensive aspects to them, which makes combat tricks a bit less appealing. Still, the rate on this is quite good, and I suspect it’ll be a card you’re happy to play."},{"CardName":"Bring to Trial","Rating":"2.5","Description":"At 3 mana I’m likely to main deck the first copy of this almost every time. You won’t want to run multiples unless the format features a ton of gigantic monsters. I would run as many as you have in Sealed, though."},{"CardName":"Civic Stalwart","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The floor on this is pretty high—it’s a 3/3 for 4, which is at least a card. In the best case scenario, it leads to a ton of damage, both via the extra power and the fact that it enables your 2/2s to attack into 3/3s. The more aggressive you are, the better this gets, but it’s a fine playable in your average midrange deck too. It is very important to have a curve to maximize this, so focus on getting good 2s and 3s if you have a couple of Stalwarts."},{"CardName":"Concordia Pegasus","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The 2-mana 1/3 flyer is a classic, and tends to be better than it looks. I’m usually in for the first of these, and even two of them are solid if your curve needs to be lower. It just happens that these stats and cost are a good combination, and with all the 1/1 flyers from afterlife, this could be even better than normal."},{"CardName":"Expose to Daylight","Rating":"1.0","Description":"As usual, I like sideboarding disenchants in Draft and main decking them in Sealed. This is no different, so I’d recommend choosing wisely when to expose yourself."},{"CardName":"Forbidding Spirit","Rating":"3.0","Description":"In a close race this will often gain you a good amount of life (or force the opponent to take a turn off of playing spells). That’s good text on a 3/3 for 3, making this a solid addition to any white deck, whether it’s aggressive or controlling."},{"CardName":"Haazda Officer","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m not a huge fan of 3/2s for 3, as they trade down in combat too often for my liking. Pumping a creature makes this a little more appealing, but it’s still not enough to make it more than a filler."},{"CardName":"Hero of Precinct One","Rating":"3.5","Description":"It’s funny that a lowly Precinct Captain beats a Hero, but I’m still happy to play this whenever I can get it. It won’t be hard to make a couple of tokens over the course of the game, and once you get the first one you are already profiting well. This does lend itself to an aggressive deck, but even in a control deck it’s going to be a solid performer, as you can use it to generate a stream of chump blockers."},{"CardName":"Impassioned Orator","Rating":"2.5","Description":"There are a lot of good bears in this set, and this one is giving out free hugs. You don’t need a token or life gain theme to run this—as long as you have a decent amount of creatures you’ll be happy."},{"CardName":"Justiciar's Portal","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The value on this goes up dramatically when you have good enters-the-battlefield effects on your creatures, and it’s a solid counter to removal as well. I’m a little less excited about trying to ambush enemy creatures with it, as a lot can go wrong and first strike is not always enough to win a combat."},{"CardName":"Knight of Sorrows","Rating":"2.0","Description":"To my great sorrow, you can only play so many 5-drops in your deck. That said, this is a good one, as it will often trade off and net you a 1/1 in the process. It’s also a nice last-ditch defender, as it can step in front of two huge monsters and buy you a ton of time."},{"CardName":"Lumbering Battlement","Rating":"4.0","Description":"This card is awesome in both form and function. It’s an enormous beast for 5 mana, and if the opponent does kill it, you might get some nice ETB triggers. The biggest risk with this is a Pacifism effect, as you lose the Battlement and all of its passengers."},{"CardName":"Ministrant of Obligation","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I really like this card. I’m not obliged to like everything that provides card advantage, but I do like this one. It trades off and leaves you with a substantial board presence, and combines nicely with sacrifice effects if your opponent isn’t cooperating to kill it."},{"CardName":"Prowling Caracal","Rating":"1.5","Description":"In a world of 1/1 flyers, a 3/1 seems particularly poorly-positioned. We all knew cats were worse than dogs, and in this set, they are worse than bears too."},{"CardName":"Rally to Battle","Rating":"2.5 // 3.5","Description":"In a creature-heavy deck, this has a very high ceiling. When it’s good, it will often be great, as you can easily get a 2- or 3-for-1 in combat. It’s pretty sweet that attacking with everything is hard to punish, since the opponent can’t even attack back without getting ambushed. The average deck will play this, and aggressive decks full of creatures will rally love it."},{"CardName":"Resolute Watchdog","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is a really good dog. It defends you early, and defends any of your creatures late. It’s a potent on-board trick that really makes your best creatures better—it ensures they survive through most dangers."},{"CardName":"Sentinel's Mark","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Sentinel’s Mark is an extremely punishing trick. If you land it and win a combat, having a +1/+2 and vigilance left over is huge. It also gives you the option of mainphasing it for a big life swing, and the two options together make a potent card indeed. Mark my words—this is the real deal."},{"CardName":"Sky Tether","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ground-based attack decks won’t want this, but everyone else will (control decks and flyer decks most prominently). It’s an efficient way to stop an attacker, and losing flying adds some nice flavor and a real gameplay advantage."},{"CardName":"Smothering Tithe","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Even if this was just “make a Treasure per turn,” I wouldn’t be a big fan, and this is largely worse. Yes, it’s a little better against someone drawing a lot of extra cards, but that’s going to come up less than the opponent deciding they can just pay for it."},{"CardName":"Spirit of the Spires","Rating":"3.5","Description":"A good-rate flyer that makes your other flyers better is an effect I’m always in for, and this is especially good because it slots well into both Azorius and Orzhov."},{"CardName":"Summary Judgment","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is a defensive removal spell, but it’s cheap enough and effective enough that I don’t see cutting it unless your deck is both very aggressive and has no flyers. We’ll get a better picture later, but my summary judgment is that this is a good card."},{"CardName":"Syndicate Messenger","Rating":"3.0","Description":"It’s all about sending a message, and afterlife on ensures that something is getting through. This gives you just enough stats to make it worth it, and I wouldn’t cut Syndicate Messenger unless I had a ton of playables."},{"CardName":"Tenth District Veteran","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Everyone from the 10th District really needs to step up their game. The Guard was bad in Guilds of Ravnica, and the Veteran here isn’t much better. Untapping your own creatures during your attack step isn’t that valuable, and a 2/3 for 3 is not a good set of stats."},{"CardName":"Tithe Taker","Rating":"3.0","Description":"In Draft, the fancy lines of text here won’t come up all that much, but a 2/1 afterlife 1 for 2 mana is a great deal. Plus, every now and then this will make combat tricks or removal hard for your opponent to cast, which is just gravy."},{"CardName":"Twilight Panther","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is essentially a gold card, and a solid one at that. It’s at its best against Gruul and Simic, but will do decent defensive work in most matchups."},{"CardName":"Unbreakable Formation","Rating":"3.5","Description":"While this isn’t broken, it’s quite strong. It’s almost always going to be cast with the addendum bonus, but in a pinch can be used to save your team. Giving your whole squad a permanent +1/+1 bonus and getting a risk-free attack is huge, making this a great card in any creature-heavy deck."},{"CardName":"Watchful Giant","Rating":"1.5","Description":"While this is a fine deal for 6 mana, there just isn’t a pressing need to pick 6-drops early, and I suspect this will be pretty replaceable. I still like one at the top of the curve, so if you’re lacking you can bump up the rating later in the Draft."},{"CardName":"Arrester's Admonition","Rating":"3.0","Description":"A sorcery-speed bounce spell that replaces itself is well worth 3 mana, and this even gives you the option of playing it as an instant (though I’d only do that if absolutely necessary). I like this more in aggro than control, but it’s good in both."},{"CardName":"Benthic Biomancer","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The Biomancer is a fine card on its own, if unexciting (3 mana for a 2/2 plus a loot isn’t too crazy). Where it gets interesting is when you have ways to add more counters, as it gives you more looting triggers, which is a powerful engine. I’d look to combine this with Combine Guildmage, which will give you a steady stream of counters and action."},{"CardName":"Chillbringer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This card has no chill, despite the name. It’s a large flying threat that locks down the opponent’s best creature for a turn (and stops two turns of blocks), which is awesome in aggressive and control decks alike. Multiples of these stack well, and this looks like one of the best commons in the set."},{"CardName":"Clear the Mind","Rating":"1.0","Description":"While it may be clear that I’ll try and prevent myself from decking with this, that’s not a game plan I can recommend in good conscience. Maybe you can sideboard this in a control mirror, but for the most part it shouldn’t make it off the bench."},{"CardName":"Code of Constraint","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Code of Constraint plays as two different cards, and both are good. It’s either a combat trick that offers a 2-for-1, or a way to lock down an opposing creature without losing a card. I like how addendum is used on this card, and I’m happy playing as many copies as I can get."},{"CardName":"Coral Commando","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Bad stats and no abilities makes this a fishy inclusion in any deck."},{"CardName":"Essence Capture","Rating":"2.5","Description":"See, this captures the essence instead of just scattering it! The casting cost is obviously the issue here, as the card is quite powerful. A 2-mana counter that buffs one of your units and has +1/+1 counter synergies is great, but UU means you won’t be able to cast this turn 2 some of the time, and that’s a big hit. Once you’re looking at 9+ blue sources, I’d bump this up a little, but early in the Draft I wouldn’t prioritize it."},{"CardName":"Eyes Everywhere","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I don’t think Eyes Everywhere is particularly good. It costs a lot of mana to steal a creature, and leaves the opponent with a permanent scry 1 each turn. If the opponent has blue mana, things get worse, as they might start swapping this back and forth. That can lead to a weird lock where that’s all players do, but even then I don’t think this is really a card you want in your deck. If your opponent has insane creatures you can’t deal with and isn’t playing blue, maybe this is a sideboard card, but I’m not really going to be keeping an eye on this one."},{"CardName":"Faerie Duelist","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like this little guy (though he’d probably poke me for saying that). You can win combats when your 2/2 or 3/3 runs into theirs, and on defense flashing this in and double blocking lets you take down something bigger (sometimes without losing anything). Having a 1/2 flyer as a leftover isn’t bad, and I think this pesky bug will be a solid playable."},{"CardName":"Gateway Sneak","Rating":"2.5 // 3.5","Description":"This is a build-around, but an extreme one. I’d play this in any deck with even two Gates, as a 1/3 that draws a card on damage makes all your bounce and removal spells very dangerous. Once you have 5+ Gates it becomes a sick threat and can take over a game with ease. Don’t assume only the Gate deck wants this—it’ll go quickly in most any Draft."},{"CardName":"Humongulus","Rating":"1.5","Description":"There aren’t a ton of enticing Auras, which makes me a lot less inclined to run the Humongulus (great name notwithstanding). Against a ground-based aggro deck with more removal and fewer pump spells, this can be a great sideboard card, and it can (eventually) kill a control deck if need be. It’s filler, but filler that does at least have high upside."},{"CardName":"Mass Manipulation","Rating":"3.0 // 4.0","Description":"The split ratings here are to convey how good this is in a normal blue deck versus how good this is in a deck built for the late game. Paying 6 mana (4 of which is blue) to steal one creature is still pretty good, and most decks can swing that as long as you play like 10 Islands. Where this becomes a flat-out bomb is when you make a ramp/control deck with a lot of defensive measures, and reliably can cast this to take two creatures. That’s almost impossible to beat, and a very big incentive to build such a deck."},{"CardName":"Mesmerizing Benthid","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I, for one, am mesmerized. Even if you discount my soft spot for octopi, this card is just a beating. A 4/5 hexproof for 5 with upside is awesome, and the Illusions give you a lot of breathing room. You’ll often want to chump with one and conserve the other, just so hexproof sticks around, but no matter how you use this it will be great."},{"CardName":"Persistent Petitioners","Rating":"1.0","Description":"You already get to play as many copies of any card you draft as you want, so that line isn’t relevant here. As a mill win condition, this is pretty hard to get going—one card per turn isn’t enough, and getting four Advisors isn’t trivial. This looks fun, but not good."},{"CardName":"Precognitive Perception","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Drawing three and scrying three sets up your long game quite nicely. This isn’t cheap, but if you can stabilize this will win you the game in short order. I’d mostly recommend playing this main phase, but if you have a bunch of counterspells and tricks, you may end up playing it at instant speed."},{"CardName":"Prying Eyes","Rating":"1.5","Description":"While I love taking the opportunity to draw four, this costs enough mana and requires discarding, making it a niche control card more than a card I’d happily take early. Most decks just aren’t in the market to pay 6 mana and not affect the board, even if it’s an effect I like building around."},{"CardName":"Pteramander","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like Pteramander, even if you aren’t going to activate it for much less than 5 or 6. I’m still in for a flying man that eventually turns into a Dragon, and if you have a five or six spells in your deck, that’s enough to adapt by the time you hit 6 mana."},{"CardName":"Quench","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is great early but falls off a lot in the late game. The circumstances where I wouldn’t mind running a Quench or two are the following:"},{"CardName":"Sage's Row Savant","Rating":"2.5","Description":"You never feel too bad about running this, as it helps smooth out your draws at every point of the game. It’s never amazing, but cards like this do a great job of making sure you have enough playables."},{"CardName":"Senate Courier","Rating":"2.5","Description":"A 1/4 flyer for 3 is a great defensive play, and plenty of control decks will be interested in this. I don’t care whether you have white mana or not because giving it vigilance is essentially meaningless, so this is actually just a mono-blue card."},{"CardName":"Shimmer of Possibility","Rating":"2.0","Description":"It’s always fine to play this card because it helps you find your good cards (or lands), but you often just won’t have space for it. It isn’t a card that actually does anything, and my first impulse is to take it about the middle of the pack."},{"CardName":"Skatewing Spy","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I spy a fantastic card. This ends up as a 4/5 flyer by itself, which is already great, and it can lift your other creatures to the sky as well. That’s a lot of power for just 4 mana, and I’m taking this early whenever I can."},{"CardName":"Skitter Eel","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is the bread and butter of blue commons, just disgustingly eel-flavored. What will usually end up happening is that your opponent has to let this through for a few turns, and you can cast all your other spells instead of adapting it. Eventually you have nothing better to do, and this adapts into a beater, giving you a great deal overall."},{"CardName":"Slimebind","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Here’s another defensive removal spell and like others, is good for control decks and flyer decks. It’s not a catch-all, but it’s cheap enough to put your opponent in a bind."},{"CardName":"Sphinx of Foresight","Rating":"4.0","Description":"The opening hand scry bit is cute, but ultimately not a big upside. The 4/4 flyer for 4 part, on the other hand, that’s just money. It’s also nice that if this survives you get to scry each turn, not that the card needs it."},{"CardName":"Swirling Torrent","Rating":"3.0","Description":"At 6 mana, this looks expensive, but I still think it’s a good deal. You’re bouncing more than 6 mana worth of creatures most of the time, and putting one on top means you aren’t down a card either. I like this in any style of deck, though it’s at its best in aggro."},{"CardName":"Thought Collapse","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Cancel is only looking OK in this format, and this is essentially the same thing. Milling them for three randomly doesn’t do much, and may even be bad for you if they have graveyard synergies. I’ll play this in or against control, but am not excited about it."},{"CardName":"Verity Circle","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Verity Circle is a strange card, but I think control decks will want it. By itself, it’s 5 mana to draw a card and keep a creature off your back, which is a complementary pair of abilities. If you can add a couple tap effects (Chillbringer being the best of them), it becomes very strong, and once you’ve drawn enough cards you can usually take some time off to deploy them."},{"CardName":"Wall of Lost Thoughts","Rating":"1.0","Description":"At uncommon, I still don’t see a mill deck happening. That makes this a mediocre playable at best."},{"CardName":"Windstorm Drake","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Windstorm Drake needs friends, but gives the opponent the business once it has a couple. I’d slam this in any deck looking to lean on flyers, which is definitely Azorius and sometimes Simic."},{"CardName":"Awaken the Erstwhile","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Let’s just leave the Erstwhile asleep, shall we? This is a symmetrical effect that costs you 5 mana and a card, and there’s not really any good way to get an edge from it. I’d heavily advise against playing this."},{"CardName":"Bankrupt in Blood","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Bankrupt is exactly what you’ll be if you base your plans on this. Sacrificing two creatures is way too high a cost, so I’d leave this to the Constructed masterminds to break."},{"CardName":"Blade Juggler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m a big fan of this—it’s got exactly the qualities I look for in a spectacle card. It’s reasonable to cast straight up, and very good if you spectacle it out. I’d pay 5 for a 3/2 that replaces itself, and at 3 mana this is quite strong."},{"CardName":"Bladebrand","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I have this a little higher than tricks like these tend to be for a couple of reasons. The first is that it costs 2 instead of the usual 3, which is a real step forward. The second is that spectacle makes the opponent more prone to block, so you’ll have more opportunities to use this, and if you think of this as “sacrifice a creature to kill any creature it’s blocking or blocked by,” it becomes a lot more appealing. Plus, the combo with Dagger Caster is very real, and quite effective."},{"CardName":"Bloodmist Infiltrator","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Even though Orzhov wants to sacrifice creatures, it isn’t like you have an infinite well to draw from, so this isn’t busted. It is a good finisher, as chunks of 3 damage add up quickly, and in a pinch it can enable spectacle. I’ll play this in creature-heavy aggressive decks, especially with synergies like afterlife or Act of Treason, but it’s not great in control decks."},{"CardName":"Carrion Imp","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Carrion, my wayward Imp…\r\n\r\nA 4-mana 2/3 flyer needs a little extra punch to get it over the line, and sometimes gaining 2 isn’t quite it. It’s not a disaster if you end up playing this, but I wouldn’t be thrilled about it either."},{"CardName":"Catacomb Crocodile","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Douser of Lights wildly overperformed, so don’t be caught sleeping on the Croc. This is a lot of stats, even if they are strangely distributed, and I’m likely running one of these with no complaints. Well, I’ll have complaints, but they won’t be about the Croc."},{"CardName":"Clear the Stage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you can’t enable the 4 power part, this becomes much worse, but if it’s on about half the time then I really like the card. Getting a 2-for-1 attached to a kill spell is worthy of applause, and this is well worth spending 5 mana on."},{"CardName":"Consign to the Pit","Rating":"2.0","Description":"You may not like it, but you’ll play the first copy. 6 mana isn’t cheap, but you have to kill your opponent’s creatures somehow, and this will do the trick. The extra damage makes you feel less bad about spending so much mana, even if it doesn’t make this an exciting card."},{"CardName":"Cry of the Carnarium","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Sweepers can lead to huge blowouts, and this even stops afterlife from working. There are matchups where this will be one of your best cards and matchups where it won’t do a lot, but overall I suspect it’ll be worth a slot. I wouldn’t cry about getting a 1-for-1 either—this doesn’t have to kill three things to be good."},{"CardName":"Dead Revels","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I want exactly one Dead Revels in most of my decks, and I can even see playing two if my deck is particularly creature-heavy and aggressive. At 4 cost, this is acceptable, and it’s a great deal at 2, making it exactly the kind of spectacle card I’m in for."},{"CardName":"Debtors' Transport","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The games where you trade Debtors’ Transport for a 4+ drop and get two tokens, it’ll seem great. The ones where it gets bounced or Arrested less so. Overall this is a fine way to top out your curve, but you can ideally do better."},{"CardName":"Drill Bit","Rating":"1.5","Description":"You need to be able to reliably pay 1 mana for this to be worth a main deck slot. Paying 3 mana for this effect is only good in specific matchups (mostly control mirrors, or against a deck with a high-impact finisher), and I would be a bit unhappy to play it main deck most of the time."},{"CardName":"Font of Agonies","Rating":"0.0 // 1.5","Description":"This is a build-around, and a pretty narrow one at that. You need 3-4 life payment cards before this even enters the equation, and even then it doesn’t seem all that great."},{"CardName":"Grotesque Demise","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Clean, efficient removal that gets around afterlife? Sign me up."},{"CardName":"Gutterbones","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The difference between entering tapped and being unable to block is huge in Limited, and it makes this a much more useful card. You can trade it off and get it back without too much trouble, and it’s efficient enough that you don’t even need to return it to get your money’s worth. I’d play this in midrange decks happily—you don’t need to be a beatdown deck to want Ol’ Gutterbones."},{"CardName":"Ill-Gotten Inheritance","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This seems like a bit of a sleeper. The numbers don’t look impressive, but it’s a consistent source of pressure, and being able to sacrifice it for a four-turn boost is quite good. I mainly see this as an aggro finisher, and it’s nice that it keeps spectacle always enabled. I’m less excited to try and use this as a control win condition, but it’s possible there’s some utility there."},{"CardName":"Noxious Groodion","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’m glad there aren’t seven deathtouch creatures at common this time around—that was obnoxious. This will do a good job blocking against Gruul or Simic, and can get in to threaten spectacle nonsense in Rakdos."},{"CardName":"Orzhov Enforcer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I really like this card, and it’s on the verge of getting a 3.5. It’s just so efficient, and often trades up in mana and leaves you with a 1/1 flyer. It’s good in aggro spectacle decks or anything defensive, and the rate is high enough that I’ll always play it."},{"CardName":"Orzhov Racketeers","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Even though this is a little expensive, it presents the opponent with a difficult choice: they either let it through and are down a card, or trade and give you two 1/1 flyers. If you can remove blockers, it runs away with the game, and even without any additional work it will often lead to a favorable exchange."},{"CardName":"Pestilent Spirit","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Giving your spells deathtouch is neat, even if it won’t come up all that often. I suppose a Rakdos deck could end up killing giant things with burn spells, which is a nice little bonus. What I’m most interested in is a 3/2 menace with deathtouch, as that’s a great deal for 3 mana. I’d look to skew aggressive here, as forcing the opponent to double-block is incredible value."},{"CardName":"Plague Wight","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Plague Wight only works on offense, unlike Ornery Goblin, and is a solid little attacker as a result. It also walks right past Spirit tokens, putting it in the ideal spot to try and get spectacle going."},{"CardName":"Priest of Forgotten Gods","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Because of the steep cost, you can’t just throw Priest of Forgotten Gods in your deck, but it’s a potent engine when it works. Sacrificing two creatures is big, but you get a card and your opponent sacrifices a creature, plus you get 2 mana and drain them for 2. That adds up to a lot, and I’d look to be an afterlife-heavy Orzhov deck if I saw this early. This is a build-around worth remembering."},{"CardName":"Rakdos Trumpeter","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The activated ability here is expensive, but a 1/3 menace for 2 is a great way to get spectacle going. That makes the firebreathing ability more of a bonus than anything else, and aggro decks will be happy to get their hands on Rakdos Trumpeter."},{"CardName":"Spawn of Mayhem","Rating":"4.0","Description":"You don’t need to spectacle Spawn of Mayhem for it to be incredible. It’s a huge flyer with multiple upsides, even if it can be a little risky if you’re low on life. This does fit much better in Rakdos (especially since it keeps spectacle on once in play), but I’d slam it in Orzhov too."},{"CardName":"Spire Mangler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Spire Mangler is an efficient little flyer that can ambush as a 4/1 blocker, or pump one of your Spirit tokens to trade up (with the additional option of getting extra damage through). It also leaves behind a 2/1 flyer for 3, making this a solid deal all around."},{"CardName":"Thirsting Shade","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m not so thirsty for spectacle enablers that I’d play a 1/1 with bad abilities, and that’s exactly what this is. It’s expensive to pump, and ends up being too small at every point in the game."},{"CardName":"Undercity Scavenger","Rating":"2.5","Description":"In a deck with good sacrifice fodder, Undercity Scavenger goes up in value, as a 5/5 with scry 2 is definitely worth eating something small. In a normal Rakdos deck, I’m less sold, as it won’t have as many good options to devour."},{"CardName":"Undercity's Embrace","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I don’t like sacrifice effects (edicts, as they’re commonly called) in Limited much. The opponent’s worst creature is often pretty bad, and especially at 3 mana, this will trade down for a 2-drop all too often. The potential to gain 4 life makes this more interesting, and I could see siding it in against an aggro deck if you have a lot of ways to get the kicker."},{"CardName":"Vindictive Vampire","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is awesome in both Orzhov and Rakdos, as it’s a very powerful card and plays nicely with Spirit tokens and spectacle cards alike. Draining the opponent for 1 every time one of your creatures dies adds up quickly, and this is big enough that it might even attack once or twice itself."},{"CardName":"Act of Treason","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"Act is always a fun one. On the surface, it looks like an aggressive card where you take their biggest blocker and whack them over the head with it. As threatening as that may be, that’s not the best use for this, and this is a marginal aggressive card at best (because it’s pretty situational, and when it isn’t good, it does basically nothing). Where Act of Treason really shines (and gets a 3.0 rating) is in a deck with multiple ways to sacrifice creatures. Then it turns into a removal spell that gives you a free attack and the benefit of the sacrifice outlet, which is quite powerful. It’s also a card you’ll get late, because it’s rare that anyone else will want it."},{"CardName":"Amplifire","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This card is indeed fire. It may start small, but it’s going to be a 4/4 at worst, and will easily be a 6/6 or 8/8 at various points. The effect also lasts until your next turn, which means it can be a good blocker if needed. I wouldn’t go too far in changing what creatures I play because of this, but it does get worse if you’ve got a bunch of 1/1s in your deck."},{"CardName":"Burn Bright","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I guess you can use this defensively, unlike Trumpet Blast, but that’s not what I’d call a burning change. If your deck has a lot of small creatures, this may be worth a slot, but neither Gruul nor Rakdos really lend themselves to that, so this seems like it doesn’t fit in this format."},{"CardName":"Burning-Tree Vandal","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Riot is a neat ability. The smaller the creature is, the more you’re incentivized to choose the +1/+1 counter, so I like the riot creatures with attack triggers as a way to make the choice more interesting. Burning-Tree Vandal gives you at least one rummage, and will often trade off, which is a fine way to spend 3 mana. I’d still mostly choose to have a 3/2, but if they have a 2/2 in play you might as well haste it up and trade right away."},{"CardName":"Cavalcade of Calamity","Rating":"1.0","Description":"There are more go-wide payoffs in red than I’d expect, given that there aren’t a ton of enablers. I guess you could go off with Goblins from Goblin Gathering or Spirits from black afterlife cards, but I’m skeptical. Cavalcade of Calamity looks like more trouble than the payoff is worth, as you need a ton of small creatures to make this worth it."},{"CardName":"Clamor Shaman","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Clamor Shaman is going to make some noise. This is excellent in any aggressive deck, and heavily pushes you toward choosing the haste mode. If you can clear their only blocker, then next turn have a removal spell to put them down to one blocker again, you probably have won the game. You can even attack with this when they have two blockers, and they will often be forced to block this and let everything else through, which turns into a ton of damage. The only thing holding this back from a 3.5 is that it’s not great in anything but aggro, so if you know you’re going to be aggressive, feel free to take this highly."},{"CardName":"Dagger Caster","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Dagger Caster is great to begin with, but there are a couple of ways to make it one of the best cards in your deck. The easiest is Bladebrand, as this is a two-card combo that wipes the opponent’s board. It’s a really strong pairing and both cards are fine on their own, which makes me think this is worth speculating on for that alone. This does good work on its own, as it can pick off x/1s and give you good attacks, where you send in 2/2s into 3/3s and whatnot. I’m pretty high on Dagger Caster, and suspect the Bladebrand dream is real enough that it will be an early pick."},{"CardName":"Deface","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This looks like sideboard material to me. Every now and then, the opponent will have 3+ targets, at which point this is worth bringing in (it is very efficient if you can cast it)."},{"CardName":"Electrodominance","Rating":"4.0","Description":"This card lives up to its name. I’m actually a little cooler on X-spells than most people because Limited is fast enough these days that they aren’t deal-10s, but Electrodominance gives you such a tempo boost that I’m into it. Casting this with X at 4+ isn’t that hard, and can kill one of their threats plus drop a midsized threat of your own. That’s good enough for me, and sometimes this will do a ludicrous amount of damage. Instant speed also leads to ambush possibilities, which is a nice bonus."},{"CardName":"Feral Maaka","Rating":"1.5","Description":"It’s not a catastrophe if you have to run this, but it sure isn’t good. 2/2s for 2 with no abilities don’t quite maaka the cut these days."},{"CardName":"Flames of the Raze-Boar","Rating":"2.0 // 3.5","Description":"If you can reliably summon the spirit of the Raze-Boar (a.k.a. have a creature with 4 power), this card is amazing. If not, it’s an expensive way to kill a creature. I’d be fine speculating on this in general, and would be excited to have it in most Gruul decks and some Rakdos decks."},{"CardName":"Gates Ablaze","Rating":"1.0 // 3.5","Description":"I love this as a Gate deck payoff. In a deck with 4 or fewer Gates, Gates Ablaze is unplayable, and it’s only OK if you have 5-6 Gates. Once you get to 7+ this becomes awesome, and does exactly what a slow Gate deck wants. I’m looking forward to lighting people up with this one."},{"CardName":"Ghor-Clan Wrecker","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Ghor-Clan Wrecker is mediocre in all modes, though the 3/3 version sounds better. It fills out your curve, but is not a priority at all."},{"CardName":"Goblin Gathering","Rating":"1.5 // 2.5","Description":"By itself, Goblin Gathering is a little below rate. Not a ton, so it’s not a disaster if you have to run one, but definitely not exciting. Once you have 3+, Goblin Gathering becomes the real deal, and even gives you a reason to run some of the go-wide payoffs. I don’t think this is a huge build-around, but it’s a nice bit of extra action for a common."},{"CardName":"Gravel-Hide Goblin","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This rating is predicated on you being red-green, because in Rakdos this is a 1.5 at best. This has a good threat of activation going on, where the opponent often won’t be able to block and you don’t even need to spend mana. It also eventually gets to the point where you can pump it twice, making this a solid threat early and a real card late."},{"CardName":"Immolation Shaman","Rating":"3.0","Description":"A 1/3 is a little dorky, and I don’t think the triggered ability comes up all that often. Later in the game, this does get to hit for solid amounts of damage, and a 4/6 is big enough that I’ll always run this."},{"CardName":"Light Up the Stage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"You may think I’m rating this highly because I like Divination, and you aren’t completely wrong. Still, if you cast this for 1 mana it’s very powerful, and note that this lasts until the end of your next turn. That gives you a good window to play the cards, including lands, and makes it closer to Divination with upside than worse than Divination. If you don’t have good spectacle enablers, I would downgrade the rating, but most Rakdos/Gruul decks should be able to utilize this well enough."},{"CardName":"Mirror March","Rating":"0.0","Description":"I’m not into this. You pay a big up-front cost, and you don’t get a permanent advantage unless you trigger a bunch of ETB abilities. The coin-flipping part adds some spice, but if you assume Mirror March makes one token on average, that’s close enough for evaluation purposes (and makes this clearly not good enough)."},{"CardName":"Rix Maadi Reveler","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This card is sweet. Weird, but sweet. The discard isn’t optional, in either case, so keep that in mind, but it still makes this a good card for either cost. It gets a lot better in Rakdos, obviously, but I’d still play it in Gruul as a Rummaging Bear."},{"CardName":"Rubble Reading","Rating":"0.0","Description":"I’ve read this story, and it doesn’t end well. Please don’t put land destruction in your deck."},{"CardName":"Rubblebelt Recluse","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Must attack is not a huge drawback on a huge monster, so Rubblebelt Recluse is basically just an undercosted giant. I’m in for that, and will happily play a pair of these."},{"CardName":"Rumbling Ruin","Rating":"3.0","Description":"As strange as this text is (and flavor too), this will ruin some people. At worst, it’s a 6/6 for 6, and if you manage to untap with a big adapt creature it can lead to getting a ton of damage through. This would make me prioritize adapt creatures a little more, though it works out fine with riot creatures too."},{"CardName":"Scorchmark","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Nothing wrong with 2 damage for 2 mana, and this has the upside of getting around afterlife too."},{"CardName":"Skarrgan Hellkite","Rating":"4.5","Description":"All modes of Skarrgan Hellkite are great, though there’s a lot of incentive to have it come in with a +1/+1 counter. The activated ability is very powerful, and once you get to 8 mana it is almost unbeatable (especially given that you have a 5/5 flyer in play). The backup plan of a 4/4 haste flyer is a good one, and if they are at a low life total you may want to go down that road."},{"CardName":"Skewer the Critics","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is good at 3 mana and hyper-efficient at 1 mana, making it easily the best red common and a card I want as many of as I can get. The name is cute too."},{"CardName":"Smelt-Ward Ignus","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I guess this guy dealt it, with “it” in this case being “two mediocre offerings for 2 mana.” It’s a 2/1 early for curve purposes, and has a mediocre ability later. That’s enough to play it in most aggro decks, especially with sacrifice cards, but nothing I’m getting excited about."},{"CardName":"Spear Spewer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The rating here is tricky. In a deck with spectacle cards, Spear Spewer is an auto-play and a great way to make your deck work. That puts it into solid 3 territory because the decks that want it really want it. It isn’t great in control or midrange decks without spectacle nonsense, so keep that in mind, but the effect here is powerful enough (even if symmetrical) that I’d take this early. As a side note, I don’t find this kind of card (Goblin Fireslinger being the earlier example) to be very interesting when they enable spectacle/bloodthirst. The ability is just always on when this is in play, and there’s nothing the opponent can do about it. That’s not very good game play, and I don’t see why this has to be a common at such a good rate."},{"CardName":"Spikewheel Acrobat","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Wow, if you spectacle Spikewheel Acrobat out it can… still trade for a 2-drop. Wheee."},{"CardName":"Storm Strike","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Adding scry 1 to Kindled Fury isn’t bad since that card was already a playable trick. Spectacle also encourages blocking, making Storm Strike a mana-efficient way to get an advantage."},{"CardName":"Tin Street Dodger","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’m not this hard up for spectacle outlets, so I’d rather dodge this if possible. It costs a mana to use, and is very weak when you don’t activate it."},{"CardName":"Axebane Beast","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The stats here are good enough that I’d recommend playing Axebane Beast more often than not. It’s not the flashiest card, but it will fill out your curve like the best of them."},{"CardName":"Biogenic Ooze","Rating":"4.5","Description":"I really like this card. Unless the opponent has instant-speed interaction, it immediately gives you a pair of 3/3s, and the turn after you likely can add another Ooze to the board. That leaves you with two 4/4s and a 3/3, and it just gets better from there. If this does get answered, you traded 1-for-1 and either have a 2/2 or 3/3 left over, depending on when the opponent killed it. A card that wins the game if it isn’t killed, trades advantageously against removal, and can help mount a comeback, all for 5 mana, gets a high grade in my book."},{"CardName":"Biogenic Upgrade","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Biogenic Upgrade is quite the finisher. By itself, it gives you six +1/+1 counters, and each counter you already have gives you a bonus one. That’s a lot of stats to throw around, making this a very threatening card if you have any kind of board presence at all. This isn’t the best in a control deck, as it’s not great when you are behind, but in any midrange or aggressive deck it will do good work."},{"CardName":"End-Raze Forerunners","Rating":"4.0","Description":"These herald the end of raze, I suppose, and the message gets across loud and clear. I’m not usually high on 8-drops, but when they win you the game almost every time, I am willing to change my tune. This easily hits for 11+ damage, and it can be much more than that if the board is stalled, which is worth the effort it takes to get to 8 mana. When you take this, focus on mana ramp and ways to survive until late, at which point the game goes from boring to boaring very quickly. They even give/have vigilance, so a non-lethal attack doesn’t leave you vulnerable."},{"CardName":"Enraged Ceratok","Rating":"3.5","Description":"4/4 for 4 is above the curve enough to be appealing, and the fact that Enraged Ceratok gets around chump blocks or double-blocks by small creatures is relevant too. That makes this a premium uncommon, and a card any deck will be interested in."},{"CardName":"Gatebreaker Ram","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"I’m loving these Gate payoffs. Outside the dedicated Gate deck this is wildly unplayable, but once you hit 6-7+ Gates it gets pretty broken. All you need is a 4/4 and you’re in the money, with anything past that being awesome. The Gate deck doesn’t need finishers all that badly, but this is still a nice pickup once you’re doing the thing."},{"CardName":"Gift of Strength","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I wouldn’t call this a gift—it’s a run-of-the-mill trick that you’ll play if you have a slot for it. Reach opens up ambushing possibilities, which does add a little more flying defense at no cost."},{"CardName":"Growth-Chamber Guardian","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Set aside the dream of having multiples of these because it won’t happen enough to change the value of the card. This is still a 4/4 for 2+3 mana, at your leisure, which is a card I’ll always play."},{"CardName":"Gruul Beastmaster","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Gruul Beastmaster puts a ton of power into play, especially if you have time to play it as a 3/3 and wait a turn. It works nicely with pump spells, even if you have to play them before attacking, and thrashes anyone who doesn’t have a solid defense set up. I’d mostly want to play this as a 3/3, but it’s pretty context-dependent—if you have the opportunity to get a nice shot in, then go for it."},{"CardName":"Guardian Project","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I may just be projecting, but wow does this card look good. It’s like a Beast Whisperer that is almost unkillable, and all it asks is that you don’t run a bunch of duplicates. That’s not a big ask, and it doesn’t even stop working if you have a duplicate—you just miss out on one card. I like Guardian Project a lot, and think it’ll be a very powerful engine."},{"CardName":"Incubation Druid","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m tempted to give Incubation Druid a 4.0, but drawing it late game isn’t quite impressive enough. This does do a ton if you draw it early, and once you adapt it, you have all the mana you could ever need. You also get a 3/5 body out of the deal, which is pretty great considering you already got value from the mana ramp."},{"CardName":"Mammoth Spider","Rating":"3.0","Description":"After how good Mammoth Spider was in Dominaria, and seeing that both Orzhov and Azorious have a lot of flyers, I’m giving this a flat 3. You’ll play multiples of these, and be happy to do so."},{"CardName":"Open the Gates","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The only time I’d recommend playing Open the Gates is when you are 3+ colors or if your deck wants 10+ Forests and has double-green cards. Playing a fixer that requires green to start only helps when you have a lot of green sources, a need to get Gates, or your 3rd/4th/5th color. The fail case I’m worried about is drawing this and two Mountains in your red-green decks, which is very bad."},{"CardName":"Rampage of the Clans","Rating":"0.0","Description":"I don’t even like Rampage of the Clans as a sideboard card because giving them a 3/3 Centaur for each thing I blow up is a horrendous deal. Do not play this."},{"CardName":"Rampaging Rendhorn","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is a solid split card, and I suspect you’ll choose each mode pretty close to half the time. Either way you’re getting a good deal for 5 mana."},{"CardName":"Regenesis","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Only picking up permanents really dampens my enthusiasm for Regenesis. It’s hard to set this up, and it basically ends up being an expensive Soul Salvage, which is not exciting."},{"CardName":"Root Snare","Rating":"0.5","Description":"There’s a niche argument for this as a sideboard card against End-Raze Forerunners, but don’t get snared up in it. They would still have a 7/7 in play and all their creatures untapped, so you don’t even get ahead. Outside of that, this is pure unplayable nonsense."},{"CardName":"Sagittars' Volley","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I like Sagittar’s Volley as a sideboard card. It kills any flyer you need to kill, and cleans up afterlife tokens too. Note that killing an afterlife flyer with this will leave tokens behind, as they won’t show up until after the spell is done with its effects."},{"CardName":"Saruli Caretaker","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Saruli Caretaker requires another creature to provide mana, making it an efficient and unreliable ramp option, and one I don’t care for at all."},{"CardName":"Sauroform Hybrid","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m a big fan of flexibility, and you don’t get to be a Human Lizard Warrior without being flexible. Sauroform Hybrid fills out your curve early and becomes a real threat late, which is all you can ask for from a 2-drop."},{"CardName":"Silhana Wayfinder","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Even though Silhana Wayfinder isn’t card advantage, it’s still a 2-drop that helps you hit your third land drop when you need to, and digs for quality creatures when you don’t. Note that you can elect not to reveal anything, making this ability strict upside."},{"CardName":"Steeple Creeper","Rating":"1.5","Description":"If you’re in Simic, Steeple Creeper is passable filler. I don’t like that it trades for everything under the sun, and giving it flying is expensive, but it’s still a 3-drop that hits hard and is relevant in the late game."},{"CardName":"Stony Strength","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This is a little stronger than it would normally be because Simic has a couple of cards that trigger on getting +1/+1 counters. On the other hand, if you use this as a trick on your adapt creature early, you can no longer adapt it. Overall Stony Strength is a fine playable if you need tricks, but it’s a little worse than the other tricks in the set. If you have a couple of Sharktocrabs, though, this becomes really sweet."},{"CardName":"Sylvan Brushstrider","Rating":"1.5","Description":"2 life makes Sylvan Brushstrider passable filler. I’d be wary of playing this, but as long as you’re vigilant about your curve, fitting one in isn’t too bad."},{"CardName":"Territorial Boar","Rating":"2.0","Description":"If you’ve got a Gruul deck with a lot of 4-power creatures, Territorial Boar is an exciting way to put pressure on the opponent. If you’ve only got 1-2 cards that trigger this, it gets very boaring very quickly. Note that riot creatures with 3 power won’t do the trick, as the timing isn’t right for the Boar."},{"CardName":"Titanic Brawl","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I think Titanic Brawl will end up being good this time around. Fight effects vary wildly based on the stats in the format, and Simic and Gruul both have a lot of beaters. Plus, being cheaper matters, and a 1-mana spell of this power level is often going to be a huge blowout."},{"CardName":"Tower Defense","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I don’t know what the tower is, but I don’t plan on defending it. The combo with High Alert is cute, though Bant Walls is not exactly a well-supported archetype."},{"CardName":"Trollbred Guardian","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Trollbred Guardian is huge before it adapts, immense once it does, and can even give other creatures trample (while trampling itself). That’s a lot for 5 mana, and this is one of the better Simic monsters around, even if you discount my affinity for Trolls."},{"CardName":"Wilderness Reclamation","Rating":"0.5","Description":"The only way I could see Wilderness Reclamation making the cut is if you have 10+ instants/adapt creatures, and even then I’m suspicious. It’s just too hard to make use of the extra mana, and spending a card on this isn’t great."},{"CardName":"Wrecking Beast","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This will really hit the opponent like a wrecking ball if they aren’t prepared, and I like having one to top off my curve. You’re going to pick haste almost all the time, and Wrecking Beast gives green a substantial haste threat at common to be worried about."},{"CardName":"Absorb","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Azorius will be in the market for 3-mana counters often enough that Absorb will be a solid playable, but it’s nothing special. 3 life is enough of a bonus that I’ll feel good about this, but not enough of one to make me prioritize it."},{"CardName":"Azorius Knight-Arbiter","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m really high on Azorius Knight-Arbiter. I don’t think it quite cracks 3.5, but wow, is it good. It’s a huge defensive presence and a free 2 points of damage a turn, which is well worth the 5 mana you spend on it. 5-drops get clunky in multiples, but I’ll still play two or three of these because of how big of an impact they have."},{"CardName":"Azorius Skyguard","Rating":"3.5","Description":"As expensive as Azorius Skyguard is, the effect is worth it. Giving their whole team -1 power is a huge deal, and is much more powerful than it looks. This dominates the board, and is a must-kill if the opponent wants to get any kind of offense going."},{"CardName":"Deputy of Detention","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Deputy of Detention handles anything you are worried about, and can even snipe multiples from time to time. That’s a great deal for 3 mana, and this is one of the best Azorius removal spells around."},{"CardName":"Dovin, Grand Arbiter","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Dovin can run away with a game quickly, and gets a high rating as a result. There are definitely times when this makes one Thopter and gains you 2 life, but that’s balanced by the times when you play this on the play and the opponent can’t stop you from making a million Thopters. I put a high premium on cards that can dominate the game single-handedly, and Dovin can do that."},{"CardName":"Dovin's Acuity","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Information Campaign is the only thing I’m ever calling this, and it’s pretty sweet. It won’t fit into all decks, but in a deck with 5+ instants that you don’t mind mainphasing, it does do some good work. The 2 life buys you the time to use those extra cards, and Dovin’s Acuity sets you up well for the late game. It’s also too accurate that Disinformation Campaign trumps Information Campaign, but that is how the world works."},{"CardName":"Emergency Powers","Rating":"1.0 // ???","Description":"My starting position is that this card is not good. It costs a lot of mana and is mostly symmetrical, and isn’t great if you’re behind (which you’re more likely to be if you have a 7-drop rotting in your hand). That said, you can put something large into play or cast Emergency Powers at the end of the opponent’s turn, and both of those break the symmetry somewhat. I suspect this isn’t a card you want to play, but some strange control decks may be able to make use of it."},{"CardName":"High Alert","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"High Alert is unplayable in most decks and doesn’t even seem that great if you build around it. It does buff some of your Azorius creatures, but spending a card on that and having it only work on a subset of creatures isn’t where I want to be. Maybe I’ll change my mind once someone makes the three Concordia Pegasus + three Knight-Arbiter deck, but I’m not sold right now."},{"CardName":"Lavinia, Azorius Renegade","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Lavinia, Azorius Renegade is a hard-to-cast bear in Limited, and that’s about the end of it. Neither ability is likely to ever come up, so only play this if you want a 2/2 for 2."},{"CardName":"Lawmage's Binding","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Instant-speed unconditional removal for 3 mana is a steal, and this even shuts off activated abilities. Lawmage’s Binding is a premium common, and one of the best reasons to start off in Azorius."},{"CardName":"Senate Guildmage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Cheap looting is great, and gaining life can help stabilize. Two good and cheap abilities on a 2-drop is exactly where I want to be, and Senate Guildmage delivers (unlike our current Senate)."},{"CardName":"Sphinx of New Prahv","Rating":"3.5","Description":"While Senate Guildmage may not have the raw power of some of the counterparts in the “hard to cast” cycle, this is still a 4-power flyer that has vigilance and an annoying protection ability. That’s enough for me, and should prahv to be a card you’ll always be happy to run in Azorius."},{"CardName":"Sphinx's Insight","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I will play Sphinx’s Insight and be happy about it in control decks, but I would avoid it if you’re looking to tempo the opponent out. Most of the time you should cast this on your turn, with counterspells and combat tricks being the main reasons not to."},{"CardName":"Senate Griffin","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Senate Griffin is a nice, solid flyer, and the scry 1 makes it a welcome addition to any deck."},{"CardName":"Depose // Deploy","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I love the flexibility on this card. Deploy is a very powerful spell, and is good on its own, so adding the option of tapping down a key attacker or blocker (or just cycling early) is huge. I also like pseudo-splashing this—in Orzhov or Simic, you can just play Depose as a card, and maybe you have one Guildgate that helps cast Deploy if that ever comes up."},{"CardName":"Warrant // Warden","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Warrant // Warden offers two excellent cards, and they are even good at various points in the game. Warrant is a great removal spell, and is efficient enough to always be appealing. If you’re at the point in the game where you don’t need a 2-mana removal spell, Warden puts a huge threat into play. This is some real chocolate and peanut butter action, and it’s one of the better Azorius cards out there. I’m also amused by how many U/W vigilance flyers are in this set. What happened to the B/G vigilance flyer?"},{"CardName":"Bolrac-Clan Crusher","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Given how many +1/+1 counters are floating around, I think this card is going to crush. It’s got a solid set of stats, and can just hang out and toss counters until the opponent is dead (or all their creatures are). That works for me, and I’m happy to pick up more riot or adapt cards than normal once I have this."},{"CardName":"Cindervines","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Cindervines is still a sideboard card, despite the ping effect being somewhat broad. It doesn’t do quite enough without having good targets to kill, so bring this in and treat it as a Naturalize with upside."},{"CardName":"Clan Guildmage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Clan Guildmage pushes the spears pretty well, but is somewhat lacking when you don’t have a good offense lined up. That, plus the need to spend mana each turn, makes me less high on this than some of the other Guildmages. Note that the green ability puts your lands at risk, so it’s not just sending in a 4/4 token if you use it."},{"CardName":"Domri, Chaos Bringer","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Domri is good as long as he has some backup. So much for that Gruul independence, eh? Finding and playing a stream of hasty/large creatures is powerful, so try and stay ahead on board, and Domri will deliver."},{"CardName":"Frenzied Arynx","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Frenzied Arynx is a pushed common. It’s either a 3/3 haste or 4/4, both of which have trample, and in case that wasn’t enough, this has a pump ability. That is a ton of rate and abilities, making me think this got moved from uncommon at some point in the process. Either way, I’m in a frenzy thinking about getting decks with two or three of these, as they are huge threats at any point in the game. You mostly want this as a 4/4, but there are definitely games where the haste mode is better."},{"CardName":"Gruul Spellbreaker","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Gruul Spellbreaker is an elegant way to stop Settle the Wreckage in Constructed, or at least an effective way. In Limited, this is a beater, and I’d happily play it on stats alone. It’s mostly just a 3-mana 4/4 trample, which spells broken to me."},{"CardName":"Nikya of the Old Ways","Rating":"4.0*","Description":"The asterisk there indicates that some decks just can’t play this card. If you have Nikya, I’d look to play 2-4 spells max, and hope you can use them in the early game. This effect is super powerful, and I think very good. Turn 5 Nikya, turn 6 dump your hand of creatures is a nice play pattern, and it isn’t like the opponent can ignore a 5/5 either, so you will unlock your spells. I could see Nikya being an even bigger bomb, deckbuilding constraints and all. Note that you can use the extra mana on adapt, which is absurd too."},{"CardName":"Ravager Wurm","Rating":"4.5","Description":"You have a couple choices here, and all of them are great. This eats one of the opponent’s best creatures right away, and either cracks in as a 4/5 haste or sits there as a 5/6. Note that the fight does damage this, so you are less likely to want to haste it up as a result. I don’t think you can even pick the non-fight mode, so let’s save that one for Constructed."},{"CardName":"Rhythm of the Wild","Rating":"3.5","Description":"It will be awkward when you topdeck this late in the game, but it’s so powerful early that I’m willing to take that risk. Once your creatures start getting down with the Rhythm, your opponent is forced to either leave back blockers to fight against haste, at which point you just choose +1/+1, or try and race, at which point haste wins the day. Plus, it randomly hoses counterspells, which can be a nice upside."},{"CardName":"Rubblebelt Runner","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Not much to see here—you’ll run this, it’ll be solid, and every now and then it will avoid some Spirit tokens and you’ll get extra damage through."},{"CardName":"Savage Smash","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’ve been impressed with this so far (watching people play Sealed on Twitch), as this mostly leads to a nice smashing indeed. You get to kill just about any creature you want, and the +2/+2 means that you often have a nice attack afterwards."},{"CardName":"Sunder Shaman","Rating":"3.5","Description":"The casting cost on these does limit them a tiny bit, but this is still a 4-mana 5/5 that’s hard to block. That goes a long way, and if you do smash them, you also get to smash an artifact or enchantment for additional value."},{"CardName":"Zhur-Taa Goblin","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Gruul has a lot of overstatted monsters, and a 2-mana 3/3 definitely fits the bill. Sometimes Zhur-Taa Goblin will want haste, but most of the time you should just choose the Watchwolf mode."},{"CardName":"Rubble Slinger","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This is both defensive and mediocre, and Gruul is interested in neither. Maybe a Simic deck wants Rubble Slinger, but I’m still suspicious."},{"CardName":"Collision // Colossus","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’d always play Colossus in my R/G deck, and getting a free Plummet is a really nice bonus. This will usually trade up in mana and often get extra damage through, and is both a finisher and a defensive measure."},{"CardName":"Thrash // Threat","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Thrash is an efficient removal spell, and isn’t even a fight card—your creature just pummels theirs. Add to that a 4/4 trample for 4 and you’ve got an excellent card. Both halves are powerful and cheap, which makes for a card that’s never bad. Two cards that would get a 3.5 and are good in different situations makes a 4.0—that’s just math."},{"CardName":"Basilica Bell-Haunt","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This card is going to ring your opponent’s bell, and loudly at that. It puts you up a card and 3 life, and leaves a relevant body on the ground. It doesn’t get better than that for 4 mana, even if it’s color-intensive."},{"CardName":"Ethereal Absolution","Rating":"5.0","Description":"I have this as the best card in the set right now. There are some giant monsters that look powerful, but this is just so hard to interact with. It kills all their X/1s, makes your creatures 2 points of stats better relative to their creatures, and even pumps out 1/1 (that are actually 2/2) flyers. This card just seems absurd, and impossible to beat unless you’re overwhelmingly behind when you play it. I’d slam this, splash for it, whatever it takes—it’s unbelievably good."},{"CardName":"Final Payment","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The first Final Payment (which is a phrase that sounds off) is quite good. The cost goes up as you try and cast more of them, but having one will be excellent. If you’ve got a lot of afterlife cards, you can afford multiples, so keep that in mind before going into debt."},{"CardName":"Grasping Thrull","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’ve been impressed by Grasping Thrull. A 3/3 flyer for 5 doesn’t need a whole lot more to be good, and a 2-point drain life certainly gets it there. This applies pressure quickly, helps when you’re behind, and is a 5-drop I’d play as many copies of as I could get."},{"CardName":"Imperious Oligarch","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Imperious Oligarch is a really sweet 2-drop. It always provides value, and vigilance means that it can hit for 2 a turn while still defending you, which is relevant on a creature the opponent won’t want to trade with. You don’t have to do anything special to make this good, and it delivers in any style of Orzhov deck."},{"CardName":"Kaya, Orzhov Usurper","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The range on Kaya is quite high, but overall I don’t think she’s fantastic. Her -1 ability kills tokens, which is strong against afterlife cards, but past that she doesn’t impact the board at all. Her ultimate comes up quickly but doesn’t do a ton, so for the most part I’d only play Kaya as a life gain card in a control deck or as a sideboard card against tokens."},{"CardName":"Kaya's Wrath","Rating":"4.0","Description":"The cost is a little rough for a card you really want to be able to cast on turn 4, but this is still a powerful card that fits nicely into Orzhov’s strategy. It leaves you with some afterlife tokens, and often the opponent will have to overextend into your afterlife cards to begin with. That’s a lot of action on a card that already has a strong text box, and I’d take Kaya’s Wrath early and try to build a control deck."},{"CardName":"Knight of the Last Breath","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This doesn’t cast Last Breath nor can it die to it. I call shenanigans. Knight of the Last Breath is expensive, and quite vulnerable to bounce and exile effects. It is nice that afterlife 3 punishes a lot of removal, and the activated ability here is a strong one. I like this as a control finisher, but sideboard it out if your opponent has answers that don’t kill it."},{"CardName":"Mortify","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is premium removal, and I wouldn’t be embarrassed to splash it either. Taking out enchantments is a nice touch, as killing Lawmage’s Binding midcombat can lead to a nice 2-for-1."},{"CardName":"Pitiless Pontiff","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Pontiff gives you the ability to trade your worst creature for whatever is battling against this, and gives you a sacrifice outlet if you ever want to cash in an afterlife creature or trigger any other death ability. That’s a lot of action for 2 mana, and I’m always happy running this one."},{"CardName":"Seraph of the Scales","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Afterlife 2 is really what puts Seraph of the Scales over the top. It would be great without it, as a 4/3 with flying, vigilance, and deathtouch is a beater, but having this turn into two 1/1 flyers when its dealt with elevates this to true bomb status."},{"CardName":"Syndicate Guildmage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This Guildmage is passable, but not absurd. It taps down big threats, but not 3-power flyers, and while it can end the game, 5 mana is a lot to pay for the second ability. You’ll always play this in Orzhov, but won’t take it over premium removal."},{"CardName":"Teysa Karlov","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"A 2/4 for 4 impacts the board enough that I would be fine running this with just a few afterlife cards, and once you have 4+ then Teysa becomes quite good. There are also a couple other scattered death triggers around, and she works with those too."},{"CardName":"Vizkopa Vampire","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Vizkopa Vampire is easy to cast and demands a trade, which makes it a winner in my book. It’s not going to dominate the board or anything, but getting to trade off and gain 3 life is a fine deal for 3 mana."},{"CardName":"Consecrate // Consume","Rating":"3.5","Description":"A kill spell that eats their biggest creature and gains some life is good, and adding the ability to cycle is a small bonus. You won’t really want to cycle it often, but having the option is just upside."},{"CardName":"Revival // Revenge","Rating":"2.5","Description":"If you have enough Revival targets, this is a cool card. You get to justify it because it gets back a cheap creature, and sometimes Revenge drops the hammer on them. These are the kinds of split cards I love, where a very situational side is propped up by a more reliable one, giving you a cool range of effects."},{"CardName":"Bedevil","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Unconditional removal is always welcome, and the devil is in the details. This kills everything you care about, even if 99% of the time that just means “creatures.”"},{"CardName":"Captive Audience","Rating":"2.5 // 3.5","Description":"As a 7-drop, not every deck is in the target audience for this, but it’s very strong if you can land it. I’d be looking to splash this in Orzhov control, or perhaps Gruul ramp, more than I would just jam it in Rakdos aggro. One thing to note is that putting the opponent to 4 is an effective threat even out of a control deck, as long as you have a couple creatures hanging around."},{"CardName":"Cult Guildmage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m a fan of this Guildmage, and not even because I was forced to watch the performance. It enables spectacle cheaply, chips at the opponent’s life total, and in a longer game, can get card advantage from the black ability. That’s a nice combination of options, making this one of the better Guildmages."},{"CardName":"Fireblade Artist","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Fireblade Artist fits very neatly into Rakdos’s strategy, and is efficient enough to always make the cut. It’s a shame this doesn’t work with Act of Treason due to the timing of the sacrifice, but this still pressures the opponent effectively. If you have this, black afterlife cards should go up in your pick order."},{"CardName":"Get the Point","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I feel like I can’t even make a joke about the name here because the card itself already does that. Either way, it’s a good removal spell with a nice little scry 1 attached, making it a card I’ll always play and often splash for."},{"CardName":"Hackrobat","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Rakdos loves their pun names, huh? Seems a little too clever by half for this guild, but I guess I’ll roll with it. Hackrobat is an effective combatant, as it can trade with anything and beats 2/x creatures in a fight thanks to deathtouch. The spectacle cost isn’t a huge discount, but every now and then it’ll be a nice bonus."},{"CardName":"Judith, the Scourge Diva","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Judith dominates the board and makes combat nigh-impossible for your opponent. All she asks is that you have a couple creatures in play, but once that’s accomplished, she certainly delivers. Your creatures are bigger so they can’t be ignored, and when they do trade off you get to distribute a bunch of pings."},{"CardName":"Macabre Mockery","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This either functions as a burn spell or a defensive play, which is kind of a strange combination. I like this more out of the sideboard, as it can be very strong against creatures with ETB abilities or evasion, but you won’t know that until you’ve seen your opponent’s deck."},{"CardName":"Rafter Demon","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Neither mode on Rafter Demon is especially exciting, which makes this filler more than anything else. A 4-mana 4/2 is a bad deal, and a 5-mana 4/2 plus a discard is a little better, but it does take work to set up. I’m not impressed."},{"CardName":"Rakdos Firewheeler","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Firewheeler is a huge beating, even if it’s hard to cast. It eats a creature, pings them for 2, and leaves you with a 4/3 body in return. That’s a ton of action for 4 mana, and this is easily the best of the cycle."},{"CardName":"Rakdos Roustabout","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Rakdos decks seem pretty into this. A 3/2 for 3 is a little below the curve, but adding the ability to guarantee spectacle and getting extra damage through is enough to make this an always-run. Like many of the other Rakdos cards, this also plays nicely with combat tricks since the opponent will probably want to block it."},{"CardName":"Rakdos, the Showstopper","Rating":"4.5","Description":"While there aren’t a ton of other Demons, Devils, and Imps running around, Rakdos is still a huge beating. The combo of a 6/6 flyer plus a Thanos snap is a potent one, and it’ll leave your opponents not feeling so good (unless you are Pat Cox, who tried to kill five Zombie tokens with Rakdos and missed on all of them)."},{"CardName":"Theater of Horrors","Rating":"4.5","Description":"This card is really powerful, and good even in control decks. Note that when you turn on spectacle, you can play any card exiled with this, even from previous turns. That’s what really puts this over the top, and makes it a sick draw engine with upside. The ping effect not only enables Theater of Horrors, but also makes it a win condition when all else fails. This card is awesome, and a windmill slam first pick."},{"CardName":"Footlight Fiend","Rating":"2.5","Description":"From what I’ve seen, most Rakdos decks will be fiending for this, and it also fits nicely into Orzhov. I’m a little less high on this in Gruul decks, but it’s cheap and flexible, so it’s not the worst even there. This trades for 2/2s, forces spectacle through, and plays nicely with sacrifice effects. That’s a lot for 1 mana, and I like this little guy as a result."},{"CardName":"Bedeck // Bedazzle","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Bedeck is such efficient removal that this card is great just on the back of that. You won’t Bedazzle very often, but every now and then you might randomly mana screw your opponent."},{"CardName":"Carnival // Carnage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Both modes here are solid. You get to ping x/1s at a good rate or just nug the opponent and make them discard a couple of cards. I’m into it."},{"CardName":"Aeromunculus","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Aeromunculus is rock-solid, and a welcome addition to any Simic deck. A 2/3 flyer for 3 is passable, and turning into a 3/4 is a huge game."},{"CardName":"Applied Biomancy","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’ve gotten to apply some Biomancy on Arena and the results have been promising. This plays well in a ton of different situations, such as winning a combat and bouncing one of their other creatures, or blowing out double-blocks. This is cheap enough and effective enough that it should always make the cut."},{"CardName":"Biomancer's Familiar","Rating":"2.0 // 3.5","Description":"In a heavy adapt deck, this card is nuts. Your creatures all get insanely big, and it makes adapting incredibly efficient. I’d run this with even one other adapt creature, and with multiples this will be one of the best cards in your deck. Even in an adapt-light deck, your opponent may kill this just to be safe."},{"CardName":"Combine Guildmage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"With these abilities combined, this is a windmill slam. You don’t even need adapt creatures to make it pop, as this provides counters by itself (albeit at a somewhat expensive rate)."},{"CardName":"Frilled Mystic","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Here the mana cost is a much greater drawback than normal. When you have a counterspell, you need to have it on specific turns, and Frilled Mystic will sometimes be staring at you while you have three Forests and an Island in play. That said, countering their spell is a sick 2-for-1 that leaves you with a 3/2 in play, so I’d be frilled to have this in any Simic deck. Later in the Draft, if you have 3+ Simic Gates, this probably deserves a flat 3.5."},{"CardName":"Galloping Lizrog","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Much like the other Simic cards, how good Galloping Lizrog is highly depends on how many +1/+1 counters you can assemble. It’s a great payoff, as a 7/7 trample (or greater) is a lot, so if you have 4-5 cards with counters this can be a real beating. I am a little tilted that a card with the name “Galloping” doesn’t have haste, but that’s a minor issue."},{"CardName":"Growth Spiral","Rating":"2.0","Description":"There’s nothing wrong with Growth Spiral, but it’s rarely going to be a critical part of your deck. Needing exactly blue and green on turn 2 to ramp is a constraint, even if it is nice that your ramp card cycles in the late game."},{"CardName":"Gyre Engineer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If this survives, it’s awesome. Tapping for 2 mana is essentially card advantage, and Simic has a lot of great mana sinks to make use of this. It is small enough to get picked off easily but I’m in for Sol Rings, even ones that cost 3 mana."},{"CardName":"Hydroid Krasis","Rating":"4.5","Description":"I’m for being well-Hydroided, and this really does the trick. At 6 mana, it gives you a 4/4 flying trample that draws two cards and gains 4 life, which is a card I’d already give a 4.0. This is even more flexible than that, and can be cast for larger and larger amounts. This is a splashable bomb, and you should almost always take it when you have the option to do so."},{"CardName":"Prime Speaker Vannifar","Rating":"3.5","Description":"While you aren’t going to get to go off like with Birthing Pod, Vannifar still gives you a solid edge over the course of the game. You need to remember exactly what creatures are left in your deck, which is easier to do online, but upgrading your creatures by 1 mana is worth it. Plus, this impacts the board nicely, and is not easy to kill. If I had a Prime Speaker, I’d change my pick order a little, as this is a real payoff for having a Pod curve."},{"CardName":"Sharktocrab","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Every week is shark week, and I think this is a borderline bomb. It’s huge even before adapt, it pressures the opponent by tapping down blockers, and if you can put more counters on it then it runs the opponent over quickly. I love this card, and have seen it take enough bites out of helpless players to think it’s incredible."},{"CardName":"Simic Ascendancy","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Simic Ascendancy will dominate any long game, though you do need to get there for it to really be good. It’s awesome at triggering cards like Sharktocrab over and over, and the alternate win condition might come up once in a blue moon."},{"CardName":"Zegana, Utopian Speaker","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Simic has some beaters in this set. Zegana replaces herself most of the time, and threatens to attack for a ton of damage without any outside help. She can also trample it up and makes your other creatures more fearsome. That’s enough for me, and I’m always in for some Zegana action."},{"CardName":"Scuttlegator","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Many decks are going to want one Gator as a finisher, but it’s expensive enough that it shouldn’t be a high priority. It blocks well for a while, and eventually gets motivated to go chomp on the opponent."},{"CardName":"Incubation // Incongruity","Rating":"2.5","Description":"In a deck with 14+ creatures, this is a fine way to get some card selection in. The Incongruity half isn’t worth a card on its own because giving them a 3/3 is a big drawback, but if you can cycle it then I like the card."},{"CardName":"Repudiate // Replicate","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Replicate is good enough to play by itself, assuming you’ve got some high-quality creatures, and every now and then you can Repudiate something like an expensive adapt trigger for the blowout."},{"CardName":"Gate Colossus","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Unplayable without Gates, and quite strong with 5+ (ideally 6 or 7), this is exactly the kind of card I love. It’s the perfect finisher for the Gates deck, and a card nobody else is likely to want."},{"CardName":"Junktroller","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This is junk, and for once I’m not trolling you. Technically it stops you from decking, but most of the time that isn’t particularly worth a card."},{"CardName":"Scrabbling Claws","Rating":"1.0","Description":"There’s not much going on here. Most decks don’t have graveyard synergies, and if you find one that does, you can side in the Claws."},{"CardName":"Screaming Shield","Rating":"1.0","Description":"If this didn’t take mana to activate, I’d be a lot more interested. As is, it takes a ton of mana to get going, which makes it hard to use this and defend yourself."},{"CardName":"Sphinx of the Guildpact","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Sphinx is a bit expensive for my tastes, and my tastes do run expensive. I just don’t like that it dies to multiple common removal spells, so I see this more as a sideboard option against decks that can’t deal with it."},{"CardName":"Tome of the Guildpact","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I like Tome of the Guildpact. It helps fix your mana and provides you a steady stream of card advantage. I’d love to draft this and go into the Gate deck, but you may be able to make this work in a less ambitious 3-color build."},{"CardName":"Azorius Locket","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Lockets get a bad rap. In slower decks, they are often worth a slot, as they help cast expensive spells and can be cracked for a pair of cards later. The non-red ones are better, as the red decks are often lower to the ground, but all of them have their uses."},{"CardName":"Gruul Locket","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Lockets get a bad rap. In slower decks, they are often worth a slot, as they help cast expensive spells and can be cracked for a pair of cards later. The non-red ones are better, as the red decks are often lower to the ground, but all of them have their uses."},{"CardName":"Orzhov Locket","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Lockets get a bad rap. In slower decks, they are often worth a slot, as they help cast expensive spells and can be cracked for a pair of cards later. The non-red ones are better, as the red decks are often lower to the ground, but all of them have their uses."},{"CardName":"Rakdos Locket","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Lockets get a bad rap. In slower decks, they are often worth a slot, as they help cast expensive spells and can be cracked for a pair of cards later. The non-red ones are better, as the red decks are often lower to the ground, but all of them have their uses."},{"CardName":"Simic Locket","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Lockets get a bad rap. In slower decks, they are often worth a slot, as they help cast expensive spells and can be cracked for a pair of cards later. The non-red ones are better, as the red decks are often lower to the ground, but all of them have their uses."},{"CardName":"Azorius Guildgate","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them. In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Gruul Guildgate","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them. In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Orzhov Guildgate","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them. In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Rakdos Guildgate","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them.

In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Hallowed Fountain","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them. In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Stomping Ground","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them. In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Godless Shrine","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them. In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Blood Crypt","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them. In the Gates deck, they are clearly high picks, and often better than shocklands even."},{"CardName":"Breeding Pool","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are two colors, I like picking up Gates over solid playables, but don’t heavily prioritize them.

For that deck to be successful, you’re going to want enough 2-drops so that this works out well. Mentor on a 3-power creature is basically free in that regard, and I don’t expect it to require you to draft very differently than you would otherwise. In a defensive deck, this becomes a lot less interesting, which is true of most mentor creatures."},{"CardName":"Bounty Agent","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The ability on this doesn’t have any targets below rare (I guess commons and uncommons don’t bring a big enough bounty), so this is mostly just a 2/2 vigilance for 2. That’s playable in the right beatdown deck, so that’s where the rating comes from."},{"CardName":"Candlelight Vigil","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This can’t hold a candle to removal, which is why it gets a low rating, though be aware that it can be a solid sideboard card against decks that are lacking in ways to interact. Buffing your mentor creatures can open the door to some nice plays, and this is a lot of stats if the opponent can’t easily snap off a 2-for-1."},{"CardName":"Citywide Bust","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Against some decks, this will be a bust, though I do like that it’s a sweeper that you can play in aggro decks. This looks like it will punish Golgari and Selesnya more than others, though every guild has creatures that you can arrest."},{"CardName":"Collar the Culprit","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The targeted version is a little worse, because the upside isn’t quite as high, though it being an instant is a bonus. I like playing one of these in removal-light decks, and am happy to pick up extra copies for the sideboard."},{"CardName":"Conclave Tribunal","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Unconditional removal that might cost 1 or even 0 mana is really high on my list when it comes to Limited, and Conclave Tribunal offers just that. Even if you always pay full retail, this will be a solid card, and the turns where you get to convoke this out are going to be filthy. Curving into this for free on turn 4 or 5 will dramatically swing most games, and this is good no matter when you draw it."},{"CardName":"Crush Contraband","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I like this as a sideboard card. I dislike this having a creepy Boros mask dude on it."},{"CardName":"Dawn of Hope","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Dawn of Hope reminds me a little of Mastery of the Unseen, though I suspect it’s not insanely broken like Mastery was. This gives you lifelink chumpers that keep you alive, and you get to draw extra cards whenever theSoldiers go into combat, which helps you hit land drops and make more Soldiers. It’s a self-fueling engine, and will win any long game easily, while still having an impact as early as the midgame. You can lose fast games with this in play, but whenever it’s on the other side of the board, you will feel the crushing grip of inevitability approaching (Mr. Anderson)."},{"CardName":"Demotion","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"This may not look like it deserves a build-around grade, but it’s such a focused aggro card that I feel it warrants one. In an aggro deck, this is great removal, and will assist in you curving out and crushing the opponent. In a midrange or control deck, it’s close to blank, and that explains the disparate ratings."},{"CardName":"Divine Visitation","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"As far as build-arounds go, this one is divine. In a deck without token-making, this does literal zero, but if you can make two Angels you end up very far ahead. Sadly, the card file doesn’t support this all that well—white and green just don’t have much in the way of tokens, so I’m not convinced that this is something you can slam early. The best enabler is Sworn Companions, so if you have a couple of copies and see Divine Visitation, I’d go for it."},{"CardName":"Flight of Equenauts","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’d definitely pay 6 mana for this, and be quite happy at 5 or less, which makes this a great convoke incentive. You don’t need millions of creatures for this to be good, and even your average Boros deck will be happy running this as top end."},{"CardName":"Gird for Battle","Rating":"2.0","Description":"You have to be aggressive to really make this gird, but if you are it can be a game-changer. Playing this plus another creature or removal spell on turn 4 is a huge swing, especially if it lets your creatures attack when they otherwise couldn’t."},{"CardName":"Haazda Marshal","Rating":"1.0 // 2.5","Description":"By itself, Haazda Marshal is horrendous, and even in a normal deck with a bunch of creatures, it might not be good enough. But given enough support from mentor creatures and pump spells, this can be a sick threat. 1/1s for 1 get a lot better with mentor as a mechanic, and this plays exactly into that game plan."},{"CardName":"Healer's Hawk","Rating":"2.0 // 3.0","Description":"I bet you’re all ready to hear about how this card is a trap and how you shouldn’t play it. Well, the bird is the word once you add mentor and convoke to the mix, so I’m actually high on the hawk. This isn’t bad by itself, and becomes great if you can get a +1/+1 counter or two on it, or tap it to convoke out something large. I suspect these will still be a tad overdrafted, but at least they are a good addition to your deck."},{"CardName":"Hunted Witness","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Most decks won’t be on the hunt for this, but it does a fine job filling out curves for both of the guilds in its color. Plus, the flavor is great—a witness dies, prompting the Boros Legion to investigate."},{"CardName":"Inspiring Unicorn","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Inspiring Unicorn is a fierce attacker, and even benefits from its own ability—that’s perfect for any deck looking to go wide, and good even without a token theme."},{"CardName":"Intrusive Packbeast","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Tapping down two blockers opens the doors for attacks on almost any board, and with mentor, one opening is often all you need. The next turn, you have the Packbeast to attack with, plus your mentor creatures get value from the previous turn’s attacks. I wouldn’t run this outside of aggro, though it’s quite strong as the high end for beatdown."},{"CardName":"Ledev Guardian","Rating":"3.0","Description":"A 3-mana 2/4 is a card most white decks wouldn’t mind, and this can often be better than that. Playing this on turn 3 is easy, and in the right draw, this might come out for 0 mana on turn 4 or 5. Plus, 2/4 is a particularly good statline for mentor, which is some nice cross-guild synergy."},{"CardName":"Light of the Legion","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I wouldn’t worry too much about just drafting white creaturesthis is great in any deck, and its death trigger is a bonus. A huge flyer that distributes +1/+1 counters in multiple ways is something I’m in the market for, and if it gives you a little extra incentive to play white creatures over red or green ones, so be it."},{"CardName":"Loxodon Restorer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m a big fan of Loxodon Restorer, largely because the life gain makes up for tapping all of your creatures to get it into play. Your shields may be down, but your life is up, and that plus solid stats makes it so I won’t forget this elephant."},{"CardName":"Luminous Bonds","Rating":"3.5","Description":"As always, this is one of the best commons in the set, and nothing going on in Ravnica changes that."},{"CardName":"Parhelion Patrol","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Parhelion Patrol would be sweet without mentor, so adding that keyword makes it an appealing common. Granted, you aren’t likely to trigger this multiple times most games, but even once is more than enough of a pay off."},{"CardName":"Righteous Blow","Rating":"3.0","Description":"It’s not a shock that this also pulls its weight, and it does quite well in aggressive or defensive decks. Getting to attack with your 3/1 mentor creature and then casting Righteous Blow (I think this is one two-word card I won’t be shortening when describing it) is a good exchange even though your 3/1 doesn’t get damage through."},{"CardName":"Roc Charger","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m more than happy seeing this at uncommon. Pegasus Courser at common every set was getting to be a bit much, and having a break from that is welcome. The card is great, and completely changes how white decks play out, giving them good offense at any stage in the game. It even gets better with mentor, both in receiving counters and giving your fragile mentor creatures evasion."},{"CardName":"Skyline Scout","Rating":"2.5","Description":"All I’ve ever wanted from a 2-drop is that it’s relevant late game, and this fits the bill. Early on, this attacks and trades just fine, and later you will have the mana to send it to the skies. This is an aggressive card, and a good one at that."},{"CardName":"Sunhome Stalwart","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Once you have this, Healer’s Hawk becomes a lot more appealing. A 2/2 first strike for 2 is good on its own, so don’t worry too much if you don’t have many mentor targets (though do try and pick up a couple)."},{"CardName":"Sworn Companions","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This buys you a lot of time in a defensive deck, and gives you some nice mentor targets in an aggressive one. You do need to put in a little work to make this great, but I swear that it’s worth it—once you have a couple of mentor cards or a go-wide pump spell, this will deliver."},{"CardName":"Take Heart","Rating":"2.0","Description":"1 mana for +2/+2 has proven to be perfectly serviceable, and I expect this to make the cut in most Boros decks. Note that precombat pump spells open up more mentor possibilities, even if you give up some extra life in this case."},{"CardName":"Tenth District Guard","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This is about as replaceable as 2-drops get, which is why I assume it’s relegated to the tenth district instead of one of the first nine. It can make it more likely a mentor creature (or target) survives combat, but that’s not enough to make it exciting."},{"CardName":"Venerated Loxodon","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Not only is this a cheap 4/4, it also distributes a couple of +1/+1 counters on its way in (up to a full five). That makes this a ton of stats for a very low cost, and one of the better threats you can start a Draft with. This will shine in any deck, and be busted in a curve-out aggro deck."},{"CardName":"Capture Sphere","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m fine paying 4 mana for this effect, even if it leaves you vulnerable to bounce or enchantment removal down the line. Blue doesn’t usually do much better, at least not at common."},{"CardName":"Chemister's Insight","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I really hope this is good enough, because it looks like a sweet way to get an edge in a longer game. Jump-start is a substantial upgrade to Inspiration, as this does eventually see four cards, albeit for a large mana investment. In order to take full advantage of this, you’ll want to be a more controlling deck, and have plenty of ways to stabilize so that you can crush the opponent with all of your extra cards."},{"CardName":"Citywatch Sphinx","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Citywatch Sphinx is a large flyer that gives you a nice severance package when it dies. There’s nothing wrong with this as your finisher, and requiring only a single blue mana makes it easy to splash as well."},{"CardName":"Dazzling Lights","Rating":"2.0","Description":"If you have enough creatures, this can serve as a solid combat trick. By itself it’s card disadvantage, but if you can set up a fight between two creatures of equivalent size, this will dazzle your opponent nicely. Cheap surveil spells are also great with spells-matter and surveil-matters cards, of which both Izzet and Dimir have plenty."},{"CardName":"Devious Cover-Up","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Decking the opponent by looping two of these sounds amazing, and I will certainly be trying to win based on that. As for this card without those shenanigans, it’s a lot less devious, and more clunky—a 4-mana counterspell isn’t really where you want to be. Counterspells get much worse the more mana they cost, and 4 is enough that you really get punished when you leave it up and don’t get to counter something. I’d basically only run this if your opponent has a bunch of insane expensive spells or if you really are going for the decking achievement."},{"CardName":"Dimir Informant","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I love Dimir Informant. A solid defensive body plus card selection makes this a highly desirable 3-drop for every deck that isn’t completely aggressive. This works well without any surveil synergies, and gets even better once you add those. Don’t sleep on this one—it won’t go late in packs."},{"CardName":"Disdainful Stroke","Rating":"2.5","Description":"The first Disdainful Stroke isn’t bad, especially against all the guilds that aren’t Boros. They do get a lot worse in multiples, because of the risk of them being dead, so I wouldn’t prioritize this in the Draft. In Sealed, I’d always run two and might even run three—every deck is going to have a lot of good expensive cards to snipe."},{"CardName":"Dream Eater","Rating":"4.5","Description":"This is aptly-named, as it will devour the hopes and dreams of your opponent. The combination of card selection, a big flyer (at instant speed no less) and a bounce spell is really hard to fight. This is incredible at any point in the game, regardless of whether you’re ahead or behind, and digs you to whatever else you need. That makes this a certified bomb, and a card you’ll rarely want to pass."},{"CardName":"Drowned Secrets","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"This is a classic build-around, and a throwback to Dimir’s strategy from OG Ravnica. If you can pair this with blue jump-start cards and a good defensive deck, it’s a solid win condition, and punishing against opposing surveil decks."},{"CardName":"Enhanced Surveillance","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"I’m trying to figure out what a surveil deck really does with this, and I’m not quite sure. You still need a good way to win because this doesn’t provide that, even with the ability to stop you from decking. Plus, surveil 4 isn’t that much better than surveil 2, so I’m not very excited about the prospect of Enhanced Surveillance (both in this set and in real life)."},{"CardName":"Guild Summit","Rating":"1.0 // 3.5","Description":"I’m super hyped for Guild Summit. Making all of your Gates into cantrips sounds awesome, and there could be a sick deck there. I especially like that it pays you for Gates in play and ones you draw later, which makes this look like a strong incentive to draft that deck."},{"CardName":"Leapfrog","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Leapfrog will attack as a flyer enough of the time that I’m into it, and if you have enough instants it could even leap to your defense. This is better in aggressive decks, and with 3 power, can be a solid clock even by itself."},{"CardName":"Maximize Altitude","Rating":"1.5","Description":"You have to be very aggressive in order to maximize this, though it’s possible that spells-matter decks might want a 1-mana jump-start card. I like how much damage this brings to the table, as double Altitude on a key turn can push through a ton of flying beats."},{"CardName":"Mission Briefing","Rating":"1.5","Description":"With a ton of cheap spells, this is a playable, but that’s not going to be most decks. Note that you still have to pay for the spell, so this is essentially a surveil 2 Recoup that doesn’t have flashback. That’s fine, but not exciting."},{"CardName":"Murmuring Mystic","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Now this is a build-around, and given its stats, you don’t even need to do that much work. If this makes one or two Birds, you’re very far ahead, and in a dedicated jump-start deck this will be obscenely good."},{"CardName":"Muse Drake","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Cantrip creatures are my muse, and this is a card I won’t often be cutting from my deck. A 1/3 flyer is exactly what you want to keep you alive while you reap the benefits of extra cards, and this is an attractive piece of any blue control deck."},{"CardName":"Narcomoeba","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I don’t hate Narcomoeba in a deck with a lot of surveil. Getting a 1/1 flyer for free (no mana or card cost) is a big game, and if you are seeing 6-7 cards a game via surveil, that gives you a decent shot of getting this into play for free."},{"CardName":"Nightveil Sprite","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Surveil 1 each turn is a big game, and this pecks in for damage while you’re at it. Even without the surveil payoffs this is a great card, and I’d be happy to start any Draft with it."},{"CardName":"Omnispell Adept","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Let’s leave this one for the Constructed brewers, as you aren’t going to be turbo’ing out things like Enter the Infinite in Limited. Still, this is a 3/4 for 5, which doesn’t have the worst stats, and does let you play spells at a discount or at instant speed. I’d run this if I was really short on creatures, which does imply a lot of spells, though I wouldn’t be looking to try and cheat in off-color spells or anything like that."},{"CardName":"Passwall Adept","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This plays both defense and offense, but does neither spectacularly well. I’ll pass."},{"CardName":"Quasiduplicate","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Getting two copies of your best creature is a very powerful effect, even if there’s more than a hint of win-more to this card. If you can stabilize behind something solid, this will give you a ton of power in the late game."},{"CardName":"Radical Idea","Rating":"1.5","Description":"A real radical idea would be this costing 1 mana, but it’s probably for the best that it didn’t. I’d only run this if I had a heavy spells-matter theme, as paying 4 mana to draw two and discard one isn’t a great deal."},{"CardName":"Selective Snare","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is a hard card to evaluate, because it will vary so drastically between matchups. At a baseline, if you’re playing an aggressive deck you should probably run this, and if you ever snipe more than one creature at once it’s excellent. Control decks don’t want this, and you have to be selective while sideboarding—against some decks this will be awesome."},{"CardName":"Sinister Sabotage","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Against all of the guilds except Boros, countering a spell for 3 mana is decent, and the addition of surveil makes this a great value proposition. Cancel is usually slightly below the bar—add a surveil and all of a sudden it’s above it."},{"CardName":"Thoughtbound Phantasm","Rating":"1.5 // 3.5","Description":"In decks with a lot of surveil, this will be one of your better cards. Not only will it grow to threatening proportions, a cheap defensive body is exactly what a deck full of fiddly surveil cards wants. This is bound to be underrated, and I’m a big fan."},{"CardName":"Unexplained Disappearance","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This will disappear from packs quickly, but there is a clear explanation—it’s a good card and fits well into any deck. Bounce plus surveil is a great deal for 2 mana, and I’d be happy to run multiples."},{"CardName":"Vedalken Mesmerist","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Vedalken Mesmerist has convinced me that it’s going to play well, especially in Izzet. This can help you push through damage and make profitable attacks, especially when you add some combat tricks to the mix. Blue isn’t the best color for this, as it would be a lot more exciting in white."},{"CardName":"Wall of Mist","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Sitting behind a Wall of Mist and surveilling sounds like an ideal situation to me, and Chemister’s Insight doesn’t sound half bad either. As far as defensive plays go, this is one of the better ones."},{"CardName":"Watcher in the Mist","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Creepy window peeper or not, this is a card I’ll always play. It’s a sizable body and surveil 2 is pretty close to drawing a card in the mid-to-late game.\r\n\r\nAuthor’s Note: I somehow missed that this has flying – that makes it by far the best blue common, and one of the best commons overall. It upgrades the rating to 3.5, and makes it a card you should rarely pass – LSV"},{"CardName":"Wishcoin Crab","Rating":"1.0","Description":"One of my wishes for this format is that I never have to play the Crab. A vanilla 2/5 is just not that exciting, and you can do better almost all the time."},{"CardName":"Barrier of Bones","Rating":"1.0","Description":"The barrier for entry is high when it comes to purely defensive plays, and surveil 1 doesn’t make up for how small this is. I also don’t like 0-power defenders much against mentor, which is making me rethink my rating on Wall of Mist."},{"CardName":"Bartizan Bats","Rating":"2.0","Description":"The last time we saw a 3/1 flyer for 4, it had minor Vampire synergies propping it up. Here, you just have undergrowth, which isn’t nothing. This is still pretty fragile, so there’s no shame in leaving it out of your deck."},{"CardName":"Blood Operative","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Things are certainly going to get bloody when this thing hits the board, as a 3/1 lifesteal can’t be ignored. Your opponent will likely be forced to trade if they want any chance to race, and there are so many surveil cards (28, to be exact) that it won’t be hard to bring this back a few times per game. With multiple common Auras that lock this down, don’t be afraid to use one of your removal spells on your own Blood Operative if you have ways to get it back."},{"CardName":"Burglar Rat","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Ravenous Rats was a staple in every Limited format it appeared in, and I have no reason to believe this one will be different. It always trades for at least a card, and can often get you a few life in a chump block or keep an x/1 at bay. That’s a great deal for 2 mana, and is especially nice in decks with undergrowth cards."},{"CardName":"Child of Night","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Looking at a lot of the creatures in this set, Child of Night looks a bit lackluster compared to its previous incarnations. It’s certainly a playable still, as it will often trade for a card and gain you 2-4 life, but Dimir Informant is its mortal enemy, and there are a lot of cards like that (see: the card directly above this one)."},{"CardName":"Creeping Chill","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Most surveil decks aren’t in the market for Lava Spike, even a free one that comes with 3 life attached. If your deck is both aggressive and surveil-heavy, maybe this creeps in, but for the most part this should be riding the bench. I suspect that this will be one of the most popular bad cards in the set, as people love the idea of getting something for nothing."},{"CardName":"Dead Weight","Rating":"3.5","Description":"If this rating seems high, it’s only because you haven’t had the pleasure of playing with Dead Weight before. This has a lot more flexibility than Shock, as you can weaken creatures that are too big to outright kill. That more than makes up for the sorcery speed part, and makes this one of the premier black commons. If the format ends up revolving around large creatures, maybe this is a clear second behind Deadly Visit, but the efficiency here is hard to beat."},{"CardName":"Deadly Visit","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Killing anything and getting to surveil 2 is about as close to Annihilate as we are going to get at common. This is excellent removal, and I think I’d take the first one of these over Dead Weight, though I’d likely alternate after that."},{"CardName":"Doom Whisperer","Rating":"4.5","Description":"This shouts more than whispers, as it will end most games where it comes out early (and still seems awesome even late). It’s an enormous flyer for cheap, and can find you whatever you need at the low cost of a few life."},{"CardName":"Douser of Lights","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Black doesn’t usually get creatures as beefy as this, and I’m always in for a Thornhide Wolves. I like the first one of these a lot, though at 5 mana it does conflict with the vastly superior Deadly Visit."},{"CardName":"Gruesome Menagerie","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"If you end up with a couple of good 1-drops, this goes from mediocre playable to quite exciting, so keep an eye out. It’s hard to set this up, but the reward is there, and getting a card and mana advantage is well worth spending 5 mana on. It also combos nicely with surveil, as you won’t need to have ever cast creatures before playing this."},{"CardName":"Hired Poisoner","Rating":"2.5","Description":"As far as defensive plays go, you could do worse with your money. A 1/1 deathtouch keeps the ground clear, and does it cheaply. This plays nicely with undergrowth and helps keep surveil control decks alive, making it a good fit for most black decks."},{"CardName":"Kraul Swarm","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The biggest drawback of a 4/1 flyer is that it dies too easily, and the ability here does quite a bit to mitigate that. It is still clunky to get this back and replay it, but you don’t need a 4/1 flyer to live for very long before you win the game. There is also the nice surveil synergy, as you can dump this in your bin early and get it back when you have time to use it."},{"CardName":"Lotleth Giant","Rating":"2.0","Description":"If this is doing 5+ damage, it’s a fantastic finisher. If it’s doing a lotleth, I’m not all that excited. As such, I’d want to play this in a deck focused on filling the bin, whether that’s an undergrowth deck, a surveil deck, or some combination. This isn’t quite a high enough payoff to slam early, but later in the draft will find some takers."},{"CardName":"Mausoleum Secrets","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This being restricted to just black cards makes it too situational for my tastes—there will be many games where you can’t cast this early, and even in the midgame it might be off. Add to that the problem that your best cards may not even be black, and the problem gets worse."},{"CardName":"Mephitic Vapors","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Mephitic Vapors will be a great sideboard card and a plausible main deck one, depending on how many of your own creatures it kills. Surveil 2 is a nice bonus, so if this kills even one creature you are likely ahead."},{"CardName":"Midnight Reaper","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Midnight Reaper isn’t optional, just like all grim reapers, but as long as you keep your life total high this is a fantastic card. It turns all of your other creatures into 2-for-1s, and is great when you’re chumping with things like Child of Night or Burglar Rat. Against removal, this will be the first to die, but it triggers off of itself, making it a 2-for-1 at worst."},{"CardName":"Moodmark Painter","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Undergrowth doesn’t seem that well-supported in this set, so I’m wary of the rewards that require a lot of creatures before they pay you off. At least Lotleth Giant costs 7, so you should have a well-stocked graveyard by then, whereas Moodmark Painter really wants to come down early but likely won’t grant a whole lot until later. Menace also falls off later in the game, so I’m not really sure how this fits into most decks."},{"CardName":"Necrotic Wound","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This card is a lot more appealing. It still doesn’t do a ton early, but having a 1 mana removal spell on turn 5 or 6 is still great, and if worse comes to worst this can be used as a combat trick if it’s only giving -1/-1 or -2/-2."},{"CardName":"Never Happened","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I’d sideboard this in against slow decks, or main deck it in Sealed. A one-for-one hand disruption spell that costs 3 mana is a bit slow for Draft, so you really want to make sure that the matchup is slow enough for this."},{"CardName":"Pilfering Imp","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I like this little bugger. It gets in for a few points of damage, then you can trade it off for a card in their hand before they hit their high drops. It also enables undergrowth, making this a fine playable for multiple reasons."},{"CardName":"Plaguecrafter","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Edict (sacrifice) effects are much worse in Limited than Constructed. Your opponent will be playing more creatures, and specifically more bad ones, making this a lot less effective. It’s cute that it can make them discard a card, and eating planeswalkers will definitely have Constructed implications, but for Limited I’d consider this a marginal playable more than anything exciting."},{"CardName":"Price of Fame","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Cutting a mana off of Deadly Visit and making it an instant is enough to get the 0.5 bump, and I expect this to a very high pick. Plus, you may even snipe a legendary creature, at which point the price is definitely right."},{"CardName":"Ritual of Soot","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is awkward against Selesnya, as that deck is full of overcosted creatures, but it should be effective against the other four guilds. Setting this up doesn’t seem too hard, and it isn’t that bad if you have to kill one or two of your own creatures in the process, especially if you are enabling undergrowth."},{"CardName":"Severed Strands","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"In a normal deck, this is not great. You get 2-for-1ed and the couple life you gain doesn’t make up for that. In a deck with a lot of good sacrifice fodder, this is premium removal, which is nice because you may pick them up quite late. As long as you have enough Burglar Rats and Muse Drakes, this will do the trick."},{"CardName":"Spinal Centipede","Rating":"2.5","Description":"This doesn’t turn the dial up to 11, but it’s no slouch either. This is an above-average playable, and it’ll make the cut most of the time. As long as you have enough creatures that you aren’t wasting the death trigger very often, this gives you enough stats for 3 mana that it’s worth a slot."},{"CardName":"Undercity Necrolisk","Rating":"1.5 // 3.0","Description":"Once again, how much sacrifice fodder you have determines how good this is. I do like that it’s a 3/3 for 4 base, but that alone doesn’t make it an exciting addition. Sorcery-speed sacrifice is also a lot worse than instant, as this won’t fizzle removal spells or get you value off chump blocks, so beware when comparing this to other sacrifice effects."},{"CardName":"Veiled Shade","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I can’t imagine being excited to put this into my deck. I’m not trying to throw shade—it’s just not very efficient, and not that big to start with. If you’re really lacking mana sinks, this could get there, but I hope that you can do better."},{"CardName":"Vicious Rumors","Rating":"0.0","Description":"Please, just trust me—this isn’t worth 1 mana, no matter how many different (minor) things it does. This is exactly the kind of card that looks super appealing, but besides the discard, all of the other effects aren’t worth anything (and in the case of milling them for one, can actually be a disadvantage)."},{"CardName":"Whispering Snitch","Rating":"2.5","Description":"There’s enough surveil in the format that this will basically always be good in Dimir, and can sometimes even be great. If you’re Golgari, it drops off some, but once you have 3-4 surveil cards and a need for early defense, this is worth including."},{"CardName":"Arclight Phoenix","Rating":"3.5","Description":"A Snapping Drake with haste is good enough already, and given enough jump-start cards, you may even be able to get this back (if you’re lucky). Either way, I’ll take a good aggressive flyer with upside, and would be glad to play this in Boros or a beatdown Izzet deck."},{"CardName":"Barging Sergeant","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Boros decks won’t have room for that many 5-drops, so I’m not that high on this. Still, it does give you 5/3 worth of stats and attacks immediately, so it’s a fine way to top off your curve."},{"CardName":"Book Devourer","Rating":"2.5","Description":"As a bit of a book devourer myself, I can respect the craft here. This is a big creature that hits hard, and the trigger is beneficial—keep back any extra lands or low-impact cards and get a whole new grip."},{"CardName":"Command the Storm","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Being an instant goes a long way—we’d play it no matter what, but at least now it’s got some flexibility to it. I’d rather have this in my 5-drop spot than almost any creature, so I’m fine taking this one early. Plus, as with any color that touches Izzet, spells have a slight bonus thanks to the various cards that care about them."},{"CardName":"Cosmotronic Wave","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Aggressive decks love this one weird trick, as it gets lethal through and picks off small creatures, all in one card. It may seem like the two abilities are contradictory, but that just offers more flexibility, making this a powerful common."},{"CardName":"Direct Current","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This card wasn’t quite priced to move, but it’s great anyway. It can kill two small creatures or one large one, all at the cost of an extra land or useless card. This also can go to the face, so keep that in mind when deciding how aggressively you should chump block."},{"CardName":"Electrostatic Field","Rating":"1.0 // 2.5","Description":"In a heavy spells deck, this fulfills the role of defender and of finisher, all in one. I’m still a little skeptical of 0/X defenders in a land of mentor, but repeatable, unblockable damage is a nice thing to have on a 2-drop. This is no Thermo-Alchemist, as it doesn’t get a free point of damage every turn as a baseline, which is what’s keeping it from being a 3.0."},{"CardName":"Erratic Cyclops","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Erratic Cyclops is huge, and can attack for large (and appropriately erratic) sums of damage. This is fantastic in a spells deck and pretty solid on defense even in a deck light on spells. The only place I wouldn’t want it would be in an aggressive Boros deck that doesn’t have enough spells to enable it (you want 6+, some of which are expensive)."},{"CardName":"Experimental Frenzy","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I think this card is great. I’m not sure, because it’s weird as hell, but it looks like it would be awesome in a deck with a low curve. Getting to play lands off the top helps you multi-spell, and if you ever get stuck with too many cards in hand, you can get rid of this. I definitely am going to need to experiment with this, but I think it’s a good one."},{"CardName":"Fearless Halberdier","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The only thing I fear is having to play this card. It doesn’t get mentored well (a symptom of it choosing to go guildless), and it doesn’t have particularly impressive stats."},{"CardName":"Fire Urchin","Rating":"1.0 // 2.5","Description":"In a spell-heavy deck, this is a serviceable 2-drop. It blocks well enough and can attack as a 2/3 or 3/3 later in the game. That’s not exciting, but even the brilliant Izzet need someone to clean up after their experiments, or run errands, picking up whatever weird crap they need to run experiments with."},{"CardName":"Goblin Banneret","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I like this in an aggressive Boros deck. It attacks for real damage, and often will trade with something while giving you a +1/+1 counter for your troubles. Remember to pump this before attacks if you have something to mentor on to, as it won’t even trigger if there aren’t any legal targets."},{"CardName":"Goblin Cratermaker","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Shock and Shatter on a stick is a good deal, especially when that stick is a 2/2 for 2 that can attack and block early in the game. I’d play this in any deck, and would take it early to boot. The flexibility and efficiency have me sold, though it would read better if it just said “artifact” for the second ability (I know, I know, Eldrazi in older formats makes it relevant)."},{"CardName":"Goblin Locksmith","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I love the Goblin way of picking a lock, though I won’t be in a hurry to toss this in my deck. There aren’t that many defenders, and 2/1s for 2 are a dime a dozen."},{"CardName":"Gravitic Punch","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Gravitic Punch is going to finish a lot of games, and is more a Boros card than an Izzet one. Note that it does not deal damage to creatures, so it’s really just a fancy Lava Axe (or two). This can be fizzled by bounce or removal on the creature, so in an ideal world you’d target something that’s under Luminous Bonds or Capture Sphere to mitigate that."},{"CardName":"Hellkite Whelp","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Even a baby Dragon is a Dragon, and this will chew up the opponent and their small creatures without much trouble. As far as 5-drops go, this is one of the better ones."},{"CardName":"Inescapable Blaze","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is going to end a lot of games. 6 damage to the face is a ton, and this kills almost anything you could possibly want to kill. I’m more than happy to pay 6 for this effect, and not having to worry about being countered is a nice cherry on top."},{"CardName":"Lava Coil","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I like power and I like efficiency, so I’m definitely in for a card that has both. 2 mana to kill all but the largest creatures is a great deal, and exiling them to prevent undergrowth shenanigans is some free value. Red got some good uncommon burn spells, and I expect them both to be high picks."},{"CardName":"Legion Warboss","Rating":"3.5","Description":"A lone 2/2 may stop this from doing all that much, but if you can remove their blockers, this spirals out of control in no time. I’d jam my deck full of combat tricks if I had Warboss, as the opponent try to trade for this 100% of the time."},{"CardName":"Maniacal Rage","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"Maniacal Rage is wildly unplayable outside the most aggressive of Boros decks, but it can steal games there. It’s vulnerable to bounce and removal, though the payoff is solid if you can dodge those. Remember that you can use this as a way to remove a blocker in a pinch, though it’s one of the more painful ways of doing so."},{"CardName":"Maximize Velocity","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’d really only run this if my deck was insanely aggressive or had a heavy spells-matter theme. I’m looking to maximize card quality more than velocity, and this is a way to throw away cards if you don’t have a specific plan for it."},{"CardName":"Ornery Goblin","Rating":"1.5","Description":"One of the best on-board tricks from Innistrad returns here in Ravnica, though this name is not nearly as funny to me as Ashmouth Hound was. This is a dorky 2/1, though it holds its own against 1-toughness creatures, so it will have moments of greatness."},{"CardName":"Risk Factor","Rating":"2.5","Description":"I’m a fan of taking risks in aggro decks, and this is a great place to do so. If your offense isn’t performing, this does basically nothing, but if you are pressuring the opponent, this puts them between a rock and a hard place. Often you’re going to get 4 damage from the first cast and three cards off of the jump-start, making this a great deal."},{"CardName":"Rubblebelt Boar","Rating":"2.0","Description":"*Snuffling noise intensifies.*\r\n\r\n(This is a fine card, and can help you trigger mentor, but it’s no prize pig.)"},{"CardName":"Runaway Steam-Kin","Rating":"3.0","Description":"In a base red deck, this is a really sweet card. If you can draft an Izzet deck with a ton of jump-start, you might even go off, but it’s mostly just a cheap 4/4 (given a few turns)."},{"CardName":"Smelt-Ward Minotaur","Rating":"2.5","Description":"This pulls together multiple themes, as you both need to be aggressive and have plenty of spells before this really pulls its weight. It will be pretty good in that style of Izzet deck, and some spell-heavy Boros decks will run it as well."},{"CardName":"Street Riot","Rating":"1.5","Description":"At 5 mana, this looks pricey to me. The red decks don’t seem that focused on going wide, and even though trample is nice, you need to have good creatures before it really pays off."},{"CardName":"Sure Strike","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Sure, why not? This helps with mentor when you cast it pre-combat, and will win most combats when your opponent blocks your 3/1 mentor creature. Red decks need this effect more than normal, so this looks a little better than it usually would be."},{"CardName":"Torch Courier","Rating":"1.0","Description":"I can accept that I underrated Goblin Motivator, but this one is so much worse. I really don’t think this is good enough, even with all of this mentor running around."},{"CardName":"Wojek Bodyguard","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m a fan of Boros flunkies here, as the deck isn’t designed to go solo to begin with. Bodyguard is an actual burly mentor creature, and is exactly what this deck wants to play on turn 3."},{"CardName":"Affectionate Indrik","Rating":"3.0","Description":"A 4/4 for 6 is slightly smaller than I’d like, but getting a free fight with the deal makes this pretty good. Note that you target what you want to fight, and if the opponent plays a pump spell in response, you can decline to fight. It’s a quirk of the templating, and gives you a pretty big advantage in spots like that."},{"CardName":"Arboretum Elemental","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is going to end a lot of games, but at least you have to work for it. Convoke doesn’t look as good as it was in previous incarnations because there are fewer good token makers, but that doesn’t mean this 9-drop can’t reliably be cast for 6-or-so mana. That’s a good enough deal that I’m sold, and there are some control decks that will have a hell of a time trying to stop this."},{"CardName":"Beast Whisperer","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Whispers turn into howls if this goes unchecked, and it’s cheap enough to have a very big impact on the game. You may even be able to slowroll this until you can play this plus a cheap creature in the same turn, guaranteeing the 2-for-1. I’d up my creature count if I had this, but it’s great even in a deck with as few as 12-14 creatures, just because the effect is so strong and the cost is relatively low."},{"CardName":"Bounty of Might","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Playing around this might just be impossible. It represents 9 points of damage, making it really difficult to survive if you don’t block, and it heavily swings combat if you do put blockers in front of their creatures. It even has the potential to be great on defense, and overall this is one of the best Overrun-type effects we’ve seen in a while (particularly because your opponent may not even see it coming)."},{"CardName":"Circuitous Route","Rating":"2.0 // 3.0","Description":"In a normal deck, this is exactly what the name suggests—not the most efficient way to get to the place you want to go. Casting a 4-mana ramp spell isn’t great when your curve tops out at 5. In a deck well-suited to take advantage of that ramp, this is a key part of the archetype, as ramping into 6s and 7s can be very effective. This also pairs well with card draw, as casting a draw two into a 4-drop is a perfectly good way to spend 7 mana. Between this and District Guide, there may be an uncommon-driven 5-color deck, though Urban Utopia and Lockets do provide some support at common."},{"CardName":"Crushing Canopy","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Effects like this are classically sideboard cards in Draft and main deck cards in Sealed, and this is no exception. Note that it doesn’t kill artifacts, which is a shame with all the Lockets running around."},{"CardName":"Devkarin Dissident","Rating":"2.5","Description":"This fills out your curve and has some relevance in the late game, which will help convoke decks. The rate on the pump isn’t good enough to make me excited about this, though that might be a dissenting opinion if this set ends up being very fast."},{"CardName":"District Guide","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I loved me a Civic Wayfinder, and now this gets Gates too. That makes it an easy early pick, as it leaves you open to painting with all of the colors of the wind. I’m sad it’s uncommon, but I get that it might make things too easy if it were common."},{"CardName":"Generous Stray","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Between convoke and undergrowth, I don’t think it’s too generous to give this a 3.0. By itself, it’s a fine way to use 3 mana, and it’s great once it gains some relevant synergies. I do find it funny that cats are supposed to have nine lives, yet you’ll sacrifice or chump with this at the first opportunity."},{"CardName":"Golgari Raiders","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’m not very high on undergrowth. There will definitely be decks where this is reliably a 4/4 in the midgame, but in most decks it’ll just be too small too often. This needs to be a 4/4 or bigger for me to feel like I’m getting away with something, and balancing that with the times where it’s a 2/2 makes me not want to prioritize it. Bear in mind that this is somewhat of a build-around, as having tons of cantrip creatures and surveil can change the equation, but as it stands I’m not very impressed with a lot of the undergrowth payoffs."},{"CardName":"Grappling Sundew","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Convoke decks are in the market for cheap creatures, and this can help you survive until your Siege Wurms and whatnot hit the battlefield, but I’m still grappling with how badly 0-power defenders line up against mentor. I wouldn’t prioritize this, and getting indestructible in the late game doesn’t move the needle much."},{"CardName":"Hatchery Spider","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is the kind of undergrowth card worth sticking to—by the time you can cast it, you’ll naturally have a fair amount of creatures in the graveyard, and it’s got solid stats and reach for the cost. Having a Hatchery Spider would bias me towards wanting green creatures, but you don’t have to go overboard—this is pretty good even if it whiffs a bunch of the time."},{"CardName":"Hitchclaw Recluse","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Defensive decks will be more than happy to hitch their wagons to this, as it stops Skyknight Legionnaires right in their tracks. The usual caveat about high-toughness low-power defenders being weak to mentor applies, but this feels like the kind of card many of the Selesnya and Golgari decks will count on."},{"CardName":"Ironshell Beetle","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This is a 2/2 for 2 with options, and that’s worth shelling out for. Making a critical creature big enough to be relevant is a good ability, and the 1/1 this leaves behind can fuel both convoke and undergrowth nicely. Aggro decks will want this as a curve-filler, and midrange/control will sometimes play it if they lack early action."},{"CardName":"Kraul Foragers","Rating":"2.5","Description":"You don’t have to gain much life for this to be worth the cost, as a 5-mana 4/4 is only slightly smaller than what I’d expect to get. Sometimes this will be awesome, as gaining 5+ life makes this into a really easy way to stabilize (and it gives you a 4/4 to then start attacking with)."},{"CardName":"Kraul Harpooner","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Kraul Harpooner is a bizarre card. It’s quite good, as a 3/2 reach for 2 is a fine deal and this will sometimes take down a big flyer, even if it takes quite the wordy text box to get there. Note that it fights, not just deals damage, so that big flyer will often take the Harpooner down with it."},{"CardName":"Might of the Masses","Rating":"2.0","Description":"When this is good, it’s amazing. In a swarm deck, getting +4/+4 or more is quite doable, and that’s a really great deal. Many decks won’t want to play it, so this almost reaches build-around levels of rating, but not quite. I’d only look to play this with 16+ creatures and a low curve, ideally with some token-making thrown in for good measure."},{"CardName":"Nullhide Ferox","Rating":"4.5","Description":"A 4-mana 6/6 would be a 4.0 already, and this has some nice abilities tacked on. It’s not strict upside, as it does limit your ability to cast noncreature spells, but the onus is on the opponent to deal with this rather than you. Plus, if you ever get to put this into play off something like Burglar Rat, the game just ends on the spot."},{"CardName":"Pack's Favor","Rating":"2.5","Description":"If you’re in the market for combat tricks, this is a good one (I imagine a market for combat tricks being some kind of open-air bazaar, with people haggling over Giant Growths and Mighty Leaps). You can even cast this without any mana untapped, which is sure to be a headache to play around over the course of the format."},{"CardName":"Pause for Reflection","Rating":"1.0","Description":"Adding convoke to Fog doesn’t really get me excited, as the effect is still way too situational. If the opponent has a massive Overrun effect, like Bounty of Might, you may want to side this in, but even then I’d be hesitant."},{"CardName":"Pelt Collector","Rating":"3.0","Description":"In a creature-heavy deck, this will grow consistently and quickly. That makes it a great deal for 1 mana, as it’s good early and still solid late."},{"CardName":"Portcullis Vine","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I like a minor defender build-around, even if most of the defenders are kind of dorky. In a control deck, getting to cycle your early defense once you don’t need it anymore is a valuable ability, so I’d play this even without other defenders."},{"CardName":"Prey Upon","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Green has sizable creatures, as usual, so Preying Upon the opposition is not hard to do. It also plays nicely with Selesnya’s acceleration, making it a little better there than in Golgari, though it’s fine in either guild."},{"CardName":"Siege Wurm","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Siege Wurm loses a little luster without Scatter the Seeds or Triplicate Spirits, but it’s still the convoke finisher of choice. Any heavy green deck should be interested, and decks with a low curve can make especially good use of the Wurm."},{"CardName":"Sprouting Renewal","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Now this is a maindeckable artifact/enchantment removal. Getting a 2/2 vigilance is a great fail case, and you can even turbo this out with your other creatures. I really like Sprouting Renewal, and would love to see more cards as flexible as this one."},{"CardName":"Urban Utopia","Rating":"1.5 // 2.5","Description":"In a normal 2-color deck, this is too expensive for what it provides. Remember, it isn’t acceleration, just color fixing, so it really only gets good once you’re at 3+ colors."},{"CardName":"Vigorspore Wurm","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Vigorspore Wurm does a lot for a common, and I wouldn’t overlook it. The undergrowth ability will often be good for a couple extra damage, and granting vigilance means that damage will usually be free. The 6/4 body may be a little vulnerable, but being immune to double-blocks goes a long way in making this a powerhouse threat. At 6 mana, you don’t want a ton of these, but I like these as the Golgari finisher of choice."},{"CardName":"Vivid Revival","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"I smell a win condition for a sweet deck here, as Vivid Renewal will seal the deal if you can get the full three cards back (and aren’t dead on board). I like cards like this, and feel that they are usually worth building towards. Here, I’d look to be a 3-color deck, though if the cards are flowing you may be able to pull this off with just one guild."},{"CardName":"Wary Okapi","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’d be wary of including this in my deck, mainly because it dies to any 2-drop. The Okapi doesn’t accomplish a lot, though it is filler if you need it. I do like that it’s a sweet, real creature, and I even saw an Okapi at the Denver Zoo last week."},{"CardName":"Wild Ceratok","Rating":"2.0","Description":"This statline is good enough to play but bad enough to not be excited about it. There’s an Andrew Baeckstrom joke here if I try hard enough, but I’m above such immature things (plus, he’s a Platinum pro now, so the joke doesn’t quite work anymore)."},{"CardName":"Impervious Greatwurm","Rating":"1.5","Description":"Most decks can’t handle something of this magnitude, and I don’t mean on the opposing side. Casting this is quite difficult, and the lack of trample is a really big deal. It’s certainly possible to build a deck with enough fodder that this comes out on turn 6 or 7, but the opponent being able to chump block makes this Wurm less than great."},{"CardName":"Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Aurelia gives you everything you want out of a bomb, and for just 4 mana. First of all, her triggered ability happens right away, so you’re getting +2/+0 and some keywords. Secondly, she’s a 2/5 flyer for 4, which happens to be very appealing stats. Lastly, she has mentor, which means that she generates value every time she swings. Note that she can target herself with her trigger, making her a 4/5 flyer with vigilance, which is perfect for any mentoring you are looking for. I can’t think of a better exemplar of a bomb than Aurelia."},{"CardName":"Boros Challenger","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Boros Challenger is a beating early and still relevant later in the game, which is exactly what Boros is looking for. It can mentor your 1-drops without any help, and if you have mana lying around, can even teach larger creatures after you pump it."},{"CardName":"Chance for Glory","Rating":"0.0","Description":"This card isn’t a stone zero, but I like doing that for effect. There’s power here, but I’m not sure how often this wins you a game you weren’t otherwise winning. It is nice if you can jam a ton of 3/1 and 4/2 mentor creatures, then save them plus set up a lethal alpha strike the next turn. I’m just suspicious of such a narrow card, as it’s literally uncastable if you aren’t planning on winning, which limits its effectiveness dramatically. It’s not a combat trick and you have to be sure that the game will conclude to put it on the stack. The real chance for glory is playing this when you need to topdeck on the extra turn, ideally as the last card in your hand so the opponent knows."},{"CardName":"Deafening Clarion","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Boros may not be first in line for a sweeper, but this is good when behind or when racing, which is enough for me. Boros also has enough mentor that you can realistically build some creatures to survive this, making it a game plan in and of itself."},{"CardName":"Fresh-Faced Recruit","Rating":"2.5","Description":"Not only is this easy to cast, it also attacks nicely and really benefits from mentoring. Boros decks need 2-drops to survive, and this is one of the better ones. I also like that it only has first strike on your turn—that’s a marked improvement to having it always, as it doesn’t gum up the ground or make attacks too difficult for the opponent. In fact, I could see a new keyword that does just that playing quite well."},{"CardName":"Garrison Sergeant","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"Once you have 3+ Gates, this becomes a premium 5-drop. Until then, it’s just a dorky lizard, one you wouldn’t trust to guard even the least important of entrances."},{"CardName":"Hammer Dropper","Rating":"2.0","Description":"You have to assume this dies as soon as you attack, though that’s where combat tricks come in. The opponent is a lock to block this, so Sure Strike and the like become basically kill spells. Plus, if this trades for a 3-drop but you got a +1/+1 counter, that’s not the worst deal."},{"CardName":"Integrity // Intervention","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Both halves of this are cards I’d gladly add to my deck, so getting them both is a fantastic deal. I’d take this early and be happy with it, and it’s even splashable. You can play this in an aggressive Izzet or Selesnya deck as a +2/+2 pump spell, and as long as you have 1-2 sources of the other color you will sometimes get to cast Lightning Helix."},{"CardName":"Justice Strike","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is a solid removal spell. It won’t kill every last thing you want, but it will kill enough, and at 2 mana this is not something I’m passing."},{"CardName":"Legion Guildmage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m not sure why, but the tap symbols on all of the Guildmages actually bums me out. It doesn’t make them that much worse, but they look a lot less appealing than when they didn’t have them. In any case, this is a good aggressive 2-drop that has multiple relevant modes in the mid- and late game. Bear in mind that you’re overpaying for either mode, but getting the option to do them both is worth it."},{"CardName":"Response // Resurgence","Rating":"3.5","Description":"If you really want a chance for glory, look here instead. Response means that this is always an efficient removal spell, which is the perfect way to get the situational but powerful finisher into your deck. Being able to cast this as a powered-up Gideon’s Reproach 90% of the time helps subsidize the 10% of the time where you cast Resurgence and just win the game. I really love the recipe here, and would gladly take this early."},{"CardName":"Skyknight Legionnaire","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I almost want to give this a 3.5, just because of how important it is in the good Boros decks. I think it’s a tiny bit short, but that still puts it at the top of the list of Boros commons. This clocks in for reliable damage every turn, and even gets to be a great Mentor target. Haste is especially nice with Mentor, as you can start the turn with just a Mentor creature and out of nowhere get the benefit of it attacking."},{"CardName":"Swathcutter Giant","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Swathcutter Giant is a beefy 6-drop, and helps Boros win games where their offense has stalled out. This hits hard, and the ping effect opens the door for your smaller creatures to attack into larger ones. You will want zero or one 6-drops in Boros, but this is one that’s worth including."},{"CardName":"Swiftblade Vindicator","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is a really sweet card. By itself, it’s not that much better than your average 2/1, but all three keywords scale up quickly once you add mentor or pump spells to the mix. This is exactly what you want to mentor on to, and I’d take this as a great sign that you should be Boros."},{"CardName":"Tajic, Legion's Edge","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Bizarre art aside (something is off there, I swear), this card should give you an edge in any game you draw it. It attacks as 4/3 worth of stats if you have something to mentor, and first strike makes it hard to block if you have mana up. The damage-prevention ability won’t come up too often, but it’s completely free, so no harm done."},{"CardName":"Truefire Captain","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The difficulty to cast does come into play here, as RRWW is much harder than RW2. If you can cast this, it’s a great way to push damage through, and mentor makes this a must-block. This gets especially nasty with combat tricks, as you can buff this big enough to survive while also having its trigger punch the opponent for 3 or 4 damage (unless the trick is Sure Strike)."},{"CardName":"Artful Takedown","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I’m in love with this card. It does a ton of tricky stuff, and does so for not much mana. As a straight-up removal spell, it’s good, and it can remove multiple blockers or stop multiple attackers with ease. I’m slamming this if I’m Dimir, and will play as many as I can get my hands on."},{"CardName":"Connive // Concoct","Rating":"4.0","Description":"This whole split card naming convention thing is not really doing it for me, but I guess that there isn’t an infinite well of Fire // Ices and Appeal // Authorities. In any case, Connive is excellent and Concoct is very good, so the combination is incredibly strong. Stealing a small-to-medium creature is well worth 4 mana, and having the option of casting this as a powered-up Rise from the Grave (your graveyard only) is a very good addition. I’d play either side of this alone, which is a great sign."},{"CardName":"Darkblade Agent","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m shocked this is a common—I read the text before looking at the rarity, and I’d have guessed uncommon, then rare, then common. That may be a clue as to how strong this is, though the complexity is part of the reason I’d have guessed a higher rarity. This is easy to enable, and very good with instant-speed surveil. There’s enough surveil that I wouldn’t call this a build-around, as it’s more just a great Dimir card."},{"CardName":"Dimir Spybug","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The same is true for Dimir Spybug, as one surveil is all it takes to make this a worthy inclusion. Once you are surveilling multiple times, it’s all gravy, and the fact that this is nearly impossible to block is nice upside as well."},{"CardName":"Discovery // Dispersal","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Half of this card being Preordain makes me pretty happy running it, especially with all of the cards that trigger off surveil. The other half being a great bounce spell (with a discard kicker) makes me all the happier."},{"CardName":"Disinformation Campaign","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is my new favorite card. It’s a little slow, but wow is it sweet. By itself, it puts you up a card, and each time you surveil you are +2 cards (once you spend 3 mana). The discard part does fall off late game, as the opponent will empty their hand, but I’m still all-in on building a deck around this."},{"CardName":"Etrata, the Silencer","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Talk about burying the lede. It took multiple read-throughs for me to realize that this shuffles itself in on a successful hit, and I’m not the only one. Still, once you understand what this does, you will be duly impressed, as it provides a huge blocker and then kills the creature of your choice when you’re ready to cash it in. Even shuffling isn’t as big of a drawback as it would normally be, as surveil-heavy decks have the tools to find this Assassin multiple times."},{"CardName":"House Guildmage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"House Guildmage locks down big threats (for a price) and provides you powerful filtering in the late game. That’s plenty of action, and I’d be happy pledging allegiance to House Dimir if I saw this early."},{"CardName":"Lazav, the Multifarious","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Lazav scales very nicely. He starts out as a decent little value creature, and soon turns into a full-blown threat, as he can copy your best dead (or surveilled) creature. This isn’t a bomb rare in the traditional sense, but it’s an efficient card that performs well at any stage in the game."},{"CardName":"Mnemonic Betrayal","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"The build-around part of this is how controlling you have to make your deck for this to be good. It reminds me of something like Villainous Wealth, or Genesis Wave—you need a ton of mana, but the payoff is large. It gets even more effective against Dimir decks, as surveil gives you lots of action, though the main factor in whether this is good is if you can survive until you have 7-8 mana in play. I bet this isn’t great most of the time, but will be a good finisher for a very controlling deck."},{"CardName":"Nightveil Predator","Rating":"3.0","Description":"The mana cost bites this one too, as it would be a 3.5 if it were a little easier to cast. The combination of stats here is pretty good—this clocks the opponent reliably and can always trade in for whatever their biggest creature is. Some Dimir decks will want to race, and this is a great way to make sure your clock isn’t disrupted."},{"CardName":"Notion Rain","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Make it rain! I like Read the Bones, and this is just better, due to surveil and graveyard synergies. It is a little awkward that your Divination requires both of your colors, as I always like it for extra fixing, but this is powerful enough that I’m not overly hung up on it."},{"CardName":"Thief of Sanity","Rating":"4.0","Description":"A cheap flyer that draws cards every time it hits is right up my alley, and even if they kill this you get to cast the exiled cards. That’s a sick ability for how little this costs, and I’m slamming this every time I see it."},{"CardName":"Thought Erasure","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m not always the highest on discard in Limited, but this is efficient enough that I’m interested. It strips them of their best threat, and even lets you surveil 1, meaning it’s never completely dead."},{"CardName":"Unmoored Ego","Rating":"0.0","Description":"I was going to do those little clappy hand things in between each word, but that’s just so unbelievably annoying that I think I’ll skip it. Please, just don’t play Surgical Extraction effects like this in Limited. It’s not worth being down a card, and your opponent’s deck will rarely ever rely on one card so much that you can spend 3 mana and a card on this effect."},{"CardName":"Whisper Agent","Rating":"3.0","Description":"It’s no secret that this is a rock-solid playable, and one that I expect to show up in Izzet and Golgari as well. It’s just two good abilities on a reasonably-costed creature, which is a great distribution of power. This will trade for something easily, sneak in for 3 damage when the opponent doesn’t expect it, and give you card selection to boot."},{"CardName":"Assassin's Trophy","Rating":"4.0","Description":"2 mana to kill anything is quite a bit better than any common or uncommon removal, and by the time you use this you won’t be giving up much by letting the opponent get a free land. Even though you want to use this later in the game (on bigger things), the fact that it costs 2 is a big deal. You can leave up mana to use this as a trick, and cast this plus a spell on the same turn. I’d try and avoid firing this off before turn 5 or so, as earlier does make the mana ramp relevant, but if you have to do that to survive, by all means do so."},{"CardName":"Charnel Troll","Rating":"3.5","Description":"There is a real risk that this runs out of food, and it does weaken your other undergrowth cards, but you do get quite the beefy body in exchange. Think of this as a 6-drop that lets you double-spell on turn 6, as you are rarely running it out early. Even under that constraint, it’s still a great deal. This demands a fast answer, so the drawback isn’t likely to be around for that many turns, and it is a lot of stats at very low cost.\r\n\r\nThere’s also a CharnelFireTroll.com joke here, but this has been a long week. Assume it was great."},{"CardName":"Erstwhile Trooper","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Erstwhile Trooper is going to play well in most Golgari decks. You need a high creature count (16+) to make it good, and once you have that it’s quite the brick wall. Imagine dropping this against a Boros deck on 3. If they don’t have a trick, they will rarely be able to attack into it, and even some of the tricks lead to a 2-for-2 trade. It also fuels undergrowth as needed, and even gains trample, so it can be a good way to start closing out games."},{"CardName":"Glowspore Shaman","Rating":"3.0","Description":"There’s a lot going on with this 2-drop, and I suspect that it will be one of the better (and few) undergrowth enablers. First of all, it mills 3 and is a 3/1, so it can get 1-2 creatures into your bin fairly soon, which is perfect when you’re trying to aim for a 4/4 Rhizome Lurcher on turn 4. It also can help you hit your third land drop, albeit at the cost of a draw step. That’s a good little package, and Glowspore Shaman is going to be solid in any Golgari deck. Even without a big undergrowth theme, a 3/1 for 2 that gives you mana screw insurance is a fine pickup."},{"CardName":"Golgari Findbroker","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I’m pretty high on Findbroker. Golgari is already interested in self-mill, between surveil cards and things like Glowspore Shaman, making this ability much more than just draw a card. It also has a good stats-to-cost ratio, making it both card advantage and tempo advantage. I’m all over this, and even the difficult mana cost doesn’t give me pause."},{"CardName":"Izoni, Thousand-Eyed","Rating":"4.5","Description":"It may take a little work to get Izoni up to a 4.5, but even in a deck with little support she is a 4.0. Making just two bugs (and I have the perfect token for you) is enough, as that’s three bodies, good total stats, and a powerful sacrifice ability. Once you are getting 3+ bugs, Izoni will take over the game, and that shouldn’t be too hard to pull off by turn 6. Having a bunch of chump blockers that you can crack for a card and a life draws out the game more, and plays nicely into Golgari’s grindy strategy. I’ve got my eye on this, and think it could be one of the best cards in the set."},{"CardName":"Molderhulk","Rating":"1.5","Description":"This, on the other hand, is not the kind of payoff I’m looking for. It’s rarely cheaper or faster than a Siege Wurm, and the enter the battlefield ability is basically irrelevant. By the time you have enough creatures in your bin to cast this, you probably don’t need a land, and it isn’t clear that you’ll even have one to target. In a really dedicated undergrowth deck, maybe this is a passable top-end card, but I’m skeptical of how often you’d cast this for 5 mana on turn 5 or 6, which is where I’d want it to be before I felt I was getting an advantage."},{"CardName":"Ochran Assassin","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Golgari isn’t normally in the market for pump spells, but this certainly changes the equation. If you give this +3/+3, it can potentially take out four creatures, and even without the dream setup, taking out two or three is realistic. By itself, it also acts as targeted removal, with the only thing it can’t kill being flyers that already got to attack (it can block ground creatures or kill any untapped flyer). It also makes it so the rest of your squad gets through, and all that added together is a lot of action for a 3 mana card."},{"CardName":"Rhizome Lurcher","Rating":"3.0","Description":"As one of the common payoffs for undergrowth, Rhizome Lurcher is solid. You just need two creatures to have died for this to be above rate, and any more than that puts you well ahead of the game. That seems doable, even if undergrowth isn’t fantastically well-supported, and Rhizome Lurcher is a bright spot (of mold) for Golgari decks."},{"CardName":"Swarm Guildmage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This is the Guildmage where the tap symbol hurts the most, as you’re giving up a 3 power menace creature when you use the ability. Still, this works when you’re behind or ahead, and is great on stalled boards, making it a good deal for just 2 mana."},{"CardName":"Undercity Uprising","Rating":"2.5","Description":"If you have a ton of fodder (Burglar Rats and Generous Strays) this goes up in value, as it’s essentially “sacrifice a creature to kill target creature”. It can also open the door to attacks by giving the team deathtouch, and remember that deathtouch plus trample is a mondo combo."},{"CardName":"Underrealm Lich","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Underrealm Lich is very hard to kill and gives you consistent draw-fixing as long as it lives. It fuels undergrowth nicely, and acts as a good attacker or good defender as long as your life total isn’t too low. The combination of card selection and resiliency makes this a premium card, and one I wouldn’t pass up."},{"CardName":"Vraska, Golgari Queen","Rating":"4.0","Description":"Vraska is quite good, as she can kill small to medium things and lets you cash in your excess permanents for value. She comes in with high loyalty if you use the +2 ability, and all that’s really lacking is her ability to defend herself against larger threats. That’s all that’s keeping her from being a bomb, as she’s not a great play into a 4-cost flyer or a Siege Wurm if you don’t have a bunch of other ways to defend her. Her ultimate is also the same Vraska ultimate we’ve seen three times, which is fine for game play, but it would be sweet to hear a new story."},{"CardName":"Pitiless Gorgon","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Pitiless Gorgon is a good defender and very easy to cast in Golgari, while being a solid card in either Selesnya or Dimir. It can even attack and prompt a trade eventually, while not worrying about any combat trick save Sure Strike. This fits Golgari’s themes well, and is a solid pick as a result."},{"CardName":"Find // Finality","Rating":"4.0","Description":"This is a brutal split card. It’s a 2-for-1 later in the game by casting double Raise Dead, something Golgari can use easily, and if needed it’s a really powerful sweeper. Giving one of your creatures permanent +2/+2 makes it quite likely to survive the -4/-4, and that’s a big enough minus that almost everything else should die. That’s a powerful set of cards to be combined, even if both lend themselves to late game play."},{"CardName":"Status // Statue","Rating":"4.0","Description":"A cheap combat trick plus a removal spell is the same recipe as Integrity // Intervention, and both will play very well. This wins a combat for cheap, and can really wreck some double or triple blocks, while also being an unconditional removal spell."},{"CardName":"Beacon Bolt","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Not every Izzet deck will want this (I’d want 9+ spells and some card draw first), but if you can support it, Beacon Bolt will be quite powerful. Killing two creatures for 6 mana and your worst card is a great deal, and this scales up nicely. Sometimes the first Bolt takes out a 2/2 and the second kills a 6/6, so it’s great that you can use this while waiting for it to power up."},{"CardName":"Beamsplitter Mage","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I expect more out of my gold 2-drops, and unless you’re casting Quasiduplicate, you aren’t getting insane value here. Copying a Maximize Altitude is decent, but not busted, so this is more of a curve-filler for aggressive Izzet decks than a build-around."},{"CardName":"Crackling Drake","Rating":"3.5","Description":"A huge flying threat that also replaces itself is very relevant to my interests. This does get docked some for being both hard to cast and requiring spell support, but that is Izzet’s jam, and having to take a Guildgate a little higher is well worth what you’re getting here. Later in the Draft this can easily move to 4.0, as it is truly awesome when you are in the deck that wants it."},{"CardName":"Firemind's Research","Rating":"1.0 // 3.0","Description":"This is certainly a build-around, and one you have to really go hard on to see benefits. Like most R&D departments, there are a lot of costs before you get a payoff, though the payoff is quite big. It’s also great that it fuels itself, as once you start drawing cards, you find more spells, and so on, with each jump-start spell counting twice (that, I believe, is the joke).\r\n\r\nEventually you’ll have enough cards that you just start building a bomb, as most respectable research does, and this ends the game nicely too. I will enjoy playing with this, though I’d want 10+ spells, and for a few of them to have jump-start, before I started getting really excited."},{"CardName":"Goblin Electromancer","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is closer to a 3.5 than you might think, because Izzet is aggressive enough to want all the different parts of the card. Being a 2-drop is important, and Izzet is very much into big double-spell turns, where you do something like Sonic Assault twice and smash for 8. I still think it lands where I rated it, but don’t sleep on Electromancer—it’s much better than it was in RtR, and it wasn’t bad there."},{"CardName":"Hypothesizzle","Rating":"3.0","Description":"There’s nothing hypothetical about my love for this card. It’s a card draw spell that also impacts the board—think of it as a 5-mana Divination that draws you a 0-mana deal 4. That’s a very good deal, even if you have to discard an actual card instead of just a land. Note that this doesn’t target when you initially cast it, and only does once you’ve discarded a nonland card (thanks to some rules trickery I won’t go into). I really like this card, and think it’s quite powerful. Any Izzet deck will want multiple copies, and I bet it’s worth splashing in Dimir sometimes."},{"CardName":"Ionize","Rating":"2.0","Description":"Attaching a face-only Shock to Cancel is more exciting in Constructed than Limited, but counterspells tend to be better in Constructed to begin with (the plays the opponent makes tend to be more scripted, so it’s easier to anticipate and leave up mana on critical turns). I’d run this in most Izzet decks, but it’s not a high priority, and certainly not a busted rare."},{"CardName":"League Guildmage","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Even without the red ability, this would be a great 2-drop in any sort of long game. Luckily, the red ability stacks nicely with the blue one, as drawing extra cards will find you sweet spells to copy. I like League Guildmage, and would happily take it early regardless of what my deck looked like."},{"CardName":"Niv-Mizzet, Parun","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Once you have three Izzet Guildgates, you can move Niv-Mizzet to a flat 5.0—the mana cost is all that’s keeping this back, since it is a harsh one. Niv checks all the boxes I look for in a bomb:\r\n\r\nGood against removal, drawing you a card in just about every instance (Conclave Tribunal aside).\nCrushing when ahead and great at comebacks (drawing extra cards and pinging cleans up boards quickly).\nPowerful by itself and even more powerful with the right synergies.\r\n\r\nNiv-Mizzet may be the best card in the set, assuming you can cast it, so slam this and go looking for Guildgates and Lockets."},{"CardName":"Ral, Izzet Viceroy","Rating":"4.5","Description":"Ral follows the standard planeswalker recipe these days (5 loyalty, +1 draw a card, -3 kill a thing), and that makes him quite powerful. You should make sure your deck is heavy on spells to power up the -3 ability but once you do, you will have no complaints about Ral’s effectiveness."},{"CardName":"Sonic Assault","Rating":"3.0","Description":"Sonic Assault encapsulates what Izzet is trying to do more than any other card. Jump-start could have been a controlling mechanic but this card file makes it a very aggressive one, and tapping down multiple creatures while dealing incidental damage is exactly what Izzet is in for. You can use this across two turns to push through repeated damage or save it up for one big turn, and either way it does its job very well. Sonic Assault is great in aggressive decks and mediocre otherwise, so ensure that you’re attacking to get full value here."},{"CardName":"Thousand-Year Storm","Rating":"1.0 // 2.0","Description":"This is a lot of mana and setup to get a payoff, though it can do some pretty wild stuff given enough time. Casting three spells in the same turn will often win you the game, but that’s not going to happen all that easily, and you have to play a 6-drop that doesn’t affect the board to set it up. I’m low on this, though obviously I’ll try and go wild if I open one."},{"CardName":"Wee Dragonauts","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\r\n\r\nIzzet decks can’t do much better than a 3/3 (or even 5/3) flyer for 3 mana, and it’s not hard for this to play that part. Left unchecked, this will end the game very quickly, and have fun doing so."},{"CardName":"Piston-Fist Cyclops","Rating":"3.0","Description":"It’s nice for Izzet that their hybrid common is a blank in Boros and not all that appealing in Dimir, as nobody else is likely to take it. Piston-Fist Cyclops attacks for a lot of damage, and does so on the very turns you are going to have an opening, thanks to cards like Sonic Assault and Maximize Altitude."},{"CardName":"Expansion // Explosion","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Both sides of this are fairly situational (I count needing 7+ mana as situational in the case of Explosion), but that’s why split cards are great. Note that you can copy opposing spells with Expansion, so sniping a removal spell is an excellent use of this card. This is a little clunky, but two powerful sides are enough to make me interested, and if you can Explode for 3 or more you should just win the game."},{"CardName":"Invert // Invent","Rating":"1.0","Description":"This card is confusing, narrow, and too expensive when it comes to the card draw part. I’d avoid including it, even if you do understand it. There is even errata, as Invert only lasts until the end of turn, which isn’t stated on the card."},{"CardName":"Camaraderie","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I’ve had the pleasure of casting this one, and it is as fun as it looks. Drawing three cards and gaining 3 life isn’t that hard to do, after which your creatures even get to swing for extra damage. It’s trivial getting more than that, at which point you’re just enjoying the sweet Selesnya gravy."},{"CardName":"Centaur Peacemaker","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This isn’t exactly a symmetrical effect, because it gives an edge to whichever deck wants the game to go long. Presumably that’s your deck, because you included this, and if it ends up that your opponent is more controlling, this is still a 3/3 for 3. I like this card a lot against Boros, and it’s playable in every matchup, as Selesnya cares more about the board than purely racing."},{"CardName":"Conclave Cavalier","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I don’t mind jumping through hoops to get something as sick as this. Conclave Cavalier is a great deal before even considering the death trigger, and once you add that you end up with one of the best creatures in the set. A 4/4 vigilance that doesn’t lose you stats when it dies is absurd, and this will trounce anyone without an Aura or exile-based removal."},{"CardName":"Conclave Guildmage","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is my least-favorite Guildmage, but it’s still a Guildmage. A 2/2 for 2 with relevant late game abilities (or ability, as the green one kind of sucks) is a solid deal. Plus, every now and then you’ll give a Worldsoul Colossus trample and feel very smart."},{"CardName":"Emmara, Soul of the Accord","Rating":"3.5","Description":"If you build your deck to maximize Emmara, she has a high top end. Back her up with a pump spell or removal spell and she starts going off, or just do the obvious thing and tap her to convoke cards. Emmara takes work, but she’s great in the good Selesnya decks, and does exactly what this guild wants to do."},{"CardName":"Join Shields","Rating":"0.5","Description":"I’m pretty down on this one. It’s a combat trick that costs 5 mana and doesn’t add any stats, making it extremely situational and hard to hold up until the late game. It does wreck sweepers, but that’s not enough to get me to put the shields up."},{"CardName":"Knight of Autumn","Rating":"4.0","Description":"I love modal cards, and this has three different ones that are all great in the right situation. It’s also nice that the 4/3 mode is an incredible fallback, as nothing special has to be going on for you to want that. I’m going to enjoy playing with this card, even though it will be more often in Constructed than Limited."},{"CardName":"Ledev Champion","Rating":"3.5","Description":"Convoke-pump is a sweet deal on a 3-mana 2/2, and making soldiers is a very relevant late game ability. Ledev Champion is self-fueling but also works nicely with convoke cards or token-making, which is exactly what Selesnya is looking to do. Having a card that’s a mix of enabler and payoff is pretty great, and helps make your deck much more consistent."},{"CardName":"March of the Multitudes","Rating":"3.5","Description":"You know what’s great when you have a bunch of tokens? Even more tokens! That actually is true, because you can just swarm the opponent, and don’t underestimate lifelink, even on 1/1s. That buys you a ton of time and makes racing untenable for the opponent. This is amazing if you tap three creatures to cast it, is good with two, and still plausible at one."},{"CardName":"Rosemane Centaur","Rating":"3.0","Description":"This is the meat and potatoes of Selesnya, though now that I say that, I think they don’t eat meat? The Boca Burger and potatoes, or are they off gluten too? In any case, Rosemane Centaur is a great payoff, as you can cast it for 4 mana and feel good, while any cheaper makes you feel awesome. This also shows you that Selesnya is about smashing with large creatures on curve, rather than going wide with tokens, as Rosemane Centaurs and Siege Wurms come out slightly ahead of schedule rather than super early."},{"CardName":"Sumala Woodshaper","Rating":"3.0","Description":"You can’t go too deep on shaping wood, as 4 mana for a 2/1 does put you behind on board, but having one or two of these gets you ahead on cards and helps find the best creatures (or Luminous Bonds) in your deck."},{"CardName":"Trostani Discordant","Rating":"4.5","Description":"By itself, this is 5/8 worth of stats, 4/4 of which has lifelink. This being in Selesnya, it rarely shows up by itself, making it an incredible amount of stats for its cost. It trades well against removal, and every now and then you’ll just blow out a Dimir opponent who stole one of your creatures."},{"CardName":"Worldsoul Colossus","Rating":"3.0","Description":"After playing with this, I can conclude it’s basically a worse Siege Wurm. That said, it’s still a Siege Wurm, and every Selesnya deck will be interested. Plus, sometimes it will come out as a 7/7 and be great."},{"CardName":"Vernadi Shieldmate","Rating":"1.5","Description":"There are a lot of better 2-drops available, but this does fill out a curve if you need that. Vigilance isn’t great on a 2/2, as it rarely gets into combat (or survives it), but this sure does tap to convoke things."},{"CardName":"Assure // Assemble","Rating":"3.5","Description":"I like both of these modes, with Assure being especially efficient. You’ll cast that one more often, but making Knights is a decent fallback."},{"CardName":"Flower // Flourish","Rating":"3.5","Description":"This may not look that great, but a ton of the power is hidden in the fact that it’s basically a tapped land that cycles. That’s a hugely powerful ability, even if the 6-mana side isn’t very efficient. In a G/W deck, the first one of these is something you can straight-up cut a land for, as any 1-land hand plus this fixes you nicely. I don’t like this at all in a deck that isn’t Selesnya, as this is not one of the hybrid cards you want to splash."},{"CardName":"Boros Locket","Rating":"1.0","Description":"If you’re jamming Boros Locket, you’re probably doing it wrong. Boros decks tend to have a low curve and don’t care about card draw, so this stands markedly behind the rest of the Lockets."},{"CardName":"Chamber Sentry","Rating":"3.5 // 4.0","Description":"In a 2-color deck, this is still pretty sweet. It’s a 2-mana 2/2 that can shoot something when needed, which is relevant at all stages of the game. It’s worth playing half-color Gates (like a Dimir Guildgate in an Izzet deck) if you have this, as extra counters are quite valuable. Once you can bring this back, it’s a win condition by itself, and will often come out as a 4/4 or 5/5, which is amazing. I’d definitely try and shoot for 5-color if I saw this early, as it’s a huge payoff."},{"CardName":"Chromatic Lantern","Rating":"1.5","Description":"In a 2-color deck, this is abysmal, and even in a 3-color deck I’m not thrilled. Only once I was 4 or 5 colors would I want Lantern, which won’t be most decks you’ll draft."},{"CardName":"Gatekeeper Gargoyle","Rating":"3.0","Description":"I’m not quite sure yet how good the Gate deck is, but Gargoyle is a solid payoff. With 2 Gates in play, this is good, and at 3+ it’s very good. The rating reflects a deck with 5+ Gates, and I wouldn’t play this with fewer than that."},{"CardName":"Glaive of the Guildpact","Rating":"0.5","Description":"This looks really bad to me. The Gate deck is naturally going to be a defensive one, and this is a very aggressive set of abilities. I’ll pass."},{"CardName":"Rampaging Monument","Rating":"2.5 // 3.5","Description":"In a deck with just a couple gold spells, this is playable, and once you hit 5+ it becomes a respectable threat. At 4/4 or greater, it truly does begin to rampage, and it’s not hard to imagine this just going ham."},{"CardName":"Silent Dart","Rating":"1.5","Description":"The mana-to-effect ratio here isn’t fantastic, and all the guilds have access to better removal options. Still, this does kill most of what needs killing, so don’t be ashamed if you’ve gotta play it."},{"CardName":"Wand of Vertebrae","Rating":"0.0","Description":"This one, however, should make you feel ashamed. This may form the skeleton of the nut Golgari undergrowth deck, but it’s too low impact and slow for me to take it seriously."},{"CardName":"Gateway Plaza","Rating":"1.5","Description":"I’d only play this if I were 3+ colors, and even then I’d hope to do better. It’s just so clunky, even though it does count as a Gate for the cards that care about that."},{"CardName":"Guildmages' Forum","Rating":"2.5","Description":"In a deck with three or more gold creatures, I’d play this, and once you are at five or more I’d definitely be happy doing so. It’s a little clunky, but the payoff of having your land produce +1/+1 counters is real."},{"CardName":"Dimir Locket","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’ve played a few Sealeds, and Lockets have been… fine. They are playable if you have a medium to high curve, and it is nice that you can crack them for two cards later in the game, but I’m still not thrilled to spend 3 mana on them early (which makes them dubious acceleration). I like these quite a bit more than any other 3-mana rocks in the past, so I’m curious to see how people rate them in a month."},{"CardName":"Golgari Locket","Rating":"2.0","Description":"I’ve played a few Sealeds, and Lockets have been… fine.

If you have any of the uncommon cycle that costs AABB, these go up a notch, and once you’re 3+ colors they definitely go up. In general, most people probably take these too low, so it’s possible you should think of them as a 3.25, if that helps."},{"CardName":"Dimir Guildgate","Rating":"3.0","Description":"If you are 2 colors, I’d take Guildgates reasonably high, over most commons of the same level (especially once you have enough playables).
