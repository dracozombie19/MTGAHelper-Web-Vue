          <p>Welcome!</p>
          <p>
            What led to me creating MTGAHelper? It all started a long time ago when I tried out a
            certain card game in high school.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can clearly remember thinking I had a very cool deck at the time: a white milling deck.
            Pretty awful in retrospect but that's how I learned to both play and love Magic...Then I
            moved on to other activities and stopped playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018,
            <strong>Magic: The Gathering Arena</strong>'s Beta reared its head and I was
            instantly hooked again by the greatest card game ever created. In all that time between high
            school and then, I also happened to become a programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started writing programs to help me analyze my data - collection, matches played, decks
            over all the web and such â€” and after a few months it came to become what is now known as
            MTGAHelper.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to share the tools I am building with all the others MTGA enthusiasts out there.
            Hopefully you enjoy it!
          </p>
